1
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,910
When we finished last time,

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,780
we were looking at
John Stuart Mill's

3
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:47,320
attempt to reply to the critics
of Bentham's Utilitarianism.

4
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,310
In his book Utilitarianism Mill
tries to show that critics

5
00:00:54,419 --> 00:01:00,350
to the contrary it is possible
within the utilitarian framework

6
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,930
to distinguish between
higher and lower pleasures.

7
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,680
It is possible to make qualitative
distinctions of worth and we tested

8
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:15,080
that idea with the Simpsons
and the Shakespeare excerpts.

9
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,490
And the results of our experiment
seem to call into question

10
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:32,820
Mill's distinction because a great
many of you reported that you prefer

11
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,190
the Simpsons but that you
still consider Shakespeare to be

12
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:42,120
the higher or the
worthier pleasure.

13
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:48,160
That's the dilemma with which
our experiment confronts Mill.

14
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,060
What about Mill's attempt to account
for the especially weighty character

15
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:58,730
of individual rights and justice
in chapter five of Utilitarianism.

16
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:07,380
He wants to say that individual rights
are worthy of special respect.

17
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,570
In fact, he goes so far as
to say that justice is

18
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,080
the most sacred part and the
most incomparably binding part

19
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:16,480
of morality.

20
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:23,320
But the same challenge could be
put to this part of Mill's defense.

21
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:32,690
Why is justice the chief part and
the most binding part of our morality?

22
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,200
Well, he says because
in the long run,

23
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,860
if we do justice and
if we respect rights,

24
00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:43,220
society as a whole will be
better off in the long run.

25
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,480
Well, what about that?

26
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,050
What if we have a case where
making an exception and

27
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,330
violating individual rights
actually will make people better off

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,170
in the long run?

29
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,310
Is it all right then
to use people?

30
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,120
And there is a further objection
that could be raised

31
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,460
against Mill's case for
justice and rights.

32
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,570
Suppose the utilitarian
calculus in the long run

33
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:16,010
works out as he says it will such
that respecting people's rights

34
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,550
is a way of making everybody
better off in the long run.

35
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,420
Is that the right reason?

36
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,130
Is that the only reason
to respect people?

37
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,480
If the doctor goes in and
yanks the organs from

38
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,970
the healthy patient who
came in for a checkup

39
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:37,010
to save five lives,

40
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:41,240
there would be adverse
effects in the long run.

41
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,470
Eventually, people would
learn about this and

42
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:46,910
would stop going
in for checkups.

43
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:49,130
Is it the right reason?

44
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,430
Is the only reason that you as a
doctor won't yank the organs

45
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,030
out of the healthy patient
that you think, well,

46
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:05,850
if I use him in this way, in the
long run more lives would be lost?

47
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,520
Or is there another reason
having to do with intrinsic respect

48
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,030
for the person as
an individual?

49
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,730
And if that reason matters
and it's not so clear

50
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:22,430
that even Mill's utilitarianism
can take account of it,

51
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,150
fully to examine these two
worries or objections,

52
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:35,230
to Mill's defense we
need to push further.

53
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:41,430
And we need to ask in the case
of higher or worthier pleasures

54
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:47,880
are there theories of the good
life that can provide

55
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,550
independent moral standards
for the worth of pleasure?

56
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:58,220
If so, what do they look like?
That's one question.

57
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,120
In the case of justice and rights,
if we suspect that Mill

58
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,340
is implicitly leaning on
notions of human dignity

59
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:12,850
or respect for person that are
not strictly speaking utilitarian,

60
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,720
we need to look to see whether
there are some stronger theories

61
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:22,980
of rights that can explain the
intuition which even Mill shares,

62
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,750
the intuition that the reason
for respecting individuals

63
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:34,950
and not using them goes beyond
even utility in the long run.

64
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:43,360
Today, we turn to one of those
strong theories of rights.

65
00:05:44,609 --> 00:05:49,710
Strong theories of right say
individuals matter not just as

66
00:05:49,859 --> 00:05:53,570
instruments to be used for
a larger social purpose

67
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,360
or for the sake of
maximizing utility,

68
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:05,180
individuals are separate beings
with separate lives worthy of respect.

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,010
And so it's a mistake,
according to strong theories

70
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,710
or rights, it's a mistake
to think about justice

71
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:21,660
or law by just adding up
preferences and values.

72
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:25,470
The strong rights theory
we turn to today is

73
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,510
libertarianism.

74
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,580
Libertarianism takes
individual rights seriously.

75
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:35,550
It's called libertarianism
because it says

76
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,920
the fundamental individual
right is the right to liberty

77
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,890
precisely because we are
separate individual beings.

78
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:53,470
We're not available to
any use that the society

79
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,180
might desire or devise
precisely because we are

80
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,210
individual separate
human beings.

81
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,240
We have a fundamental
right to liberty,

82
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:10,290
and that means a right
to choose freely,

83
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,930
to live our lives
as we please

84
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:16,930
provided we respect other
people's rights to do the same.

85
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,700
That's the fundamental idea.

86
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:24,120
Robert Nozick, one of the
libertarian philosophers

87
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,820
we read for this course,
puts it this way:

88
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,220
Individuals have rights.

89
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:35,040
So strong and far reaching
are these rights that they

90
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,550
raise the question of what,
if anything, the state may do.

91
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:49,580
So what does libertarianism
say about the role of government

92
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,750
or of the state?

93
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:56,300
Well, there are three things
that most modern states do

94
00:07:58,299 --> 00:08:02,140
that on the libertarian
theory of rights are

95
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,640
illegitimate or unjust.

96
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:10,090
One of them is
paternalist legislation.

97
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,950
That's passing laws that
protect people from themselves,

98
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:18,030
seatbelt laws, for example,
or motorcycle helmet laws.

99
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,080
The libertarian says it
may be a good thing

100
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:24,350
if people wear seatbelts

101
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,710
but that should be up to
them and the state,

102
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:32,210
the government, has no
business coercing them,

103
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:38,060
us, to wear seatbelts
by law.

104
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:44,780
It's coercion, so no paternalist
legislation, number one.

105
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,310

Number two, no
morals legislation.

106
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:54,500
Many laws try to promote
the virtue of citizens

107
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:02,260
or try to give expression to the
moral values of the society as a whole.

108
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,600
Libertarian say that's also a
violation of the right to liberty.

109
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,000
Take the example of, well,
a classic example

110
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,300
of legislation authored in the
name of promoting morality

111
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,790
traditionally have been laws that
prevent sexual intimacy

112
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,730
between gays and lesbians.

113
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,180
The libertarian says nobody
else is harmed,

114
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:33,420
nobody else's rights
are violated,

115
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,610
so the state should get out
of the business entirely of

116
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,460
trying to promote virtue or
to enact morals legislation.

117
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,990
And the third kind of law or
policy that is ruled out

118
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:58,520
on the libertarian philosophy
is any taxation or other policy

119
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:03,270
that serves the purpose of
redistributing income or wealth

120
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,150
from the rich to the poor.

121
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,870
Redistribution is a 每
if you think about it,

122
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,910
says the libertarian is
a kind of coercion.

123
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:22,260
What it amounts to is theft by
the state or by the majority,

124
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,150
if we're talking about a democracy,
from people who happen to

125
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:29,610
do very well and
earn a lot of money.

126
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:37,130
Now, Nozick and other libertarians
allow that there can be

127
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:42,800
a minimal state that taxes people for
the sake of what everybody needs,

128
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,510
the national defense,
police force,

129
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,450
judicial system to enforce
contracts and property rights,

130
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,490
but that's it.

131
00:10:53,370 --> 00:11:00,380
Now, I want to get your reactions
to this third feature

132
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,810
of the libertarian view.

133
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:10,100
I want to see who among you agree
with that idea and who disagree and why.

134
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:14,170
But just to make it concrete
and to see what's at stake,

135
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,190
consider the distribution of
wealth in the United States.

136
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:24,360
United States is among the most
inegalitarian society as far as

137
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:28,430
the distribution of wealth of
all the advanced democracies.

138
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,040
Now, is this just or unjust?

139
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:36,300
Well, what does the
libertarian say?

140
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:43,480
Libertarian says you can't know
just from the facts I've just given you.

141
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:46,980
You can't know whether that
distribution is just or unjust.

142
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:51,940
You can't know just by looking at
a pattern or a distribution or

143
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,200
result whether it's
just or unjust.

144
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,130
You have to know
how it came to be.

145
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:05,500
You can't just look at the
end stage or the result.

146
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,970
You have to look
at two principles.

147
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:14,770
The first he calls justice in
acquisition or in initial holdings.

148
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:20,030
And what that means simply is
did people get the things they used

149
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,220
to make their money fairly?

150
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,270
So we need to know was there
justice in the initial holdings?

151
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,060
Did they steal the land or
the factory or the goods

152
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,340
that enabled them to
make all that money?

153
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,050
If not, if they were entitled
to whatever it was

154
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,370
that enabled them to
gather the wealth,

155
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,650
the first principle is matched.

156
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,860
The second principle is did
the distribution arise from

157
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:52,810
the operation of free consent,
people buying and trading

158
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,300
on the market?

159
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:58,900
As you can see, the libertarian
idea of justice corresponds to

160
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:06,760
a free market conception of justice
provided people got what they used

161
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:13,160
fairly, didn't steal it, and
provided the distribution results

162
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,440
from the free choice of individual's
buying and selling things,

163
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,130
the distribution is just.

164
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,360
And if not, it's unjust.

165
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,060
So let's, in order to fix
ideas for this discussion,

166
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:36,200
take an actual example.

167
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,030
Who's the wealthiest person
in the United States 每

168
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,980
wealthiest person in the world?
Bill Gates.

169
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,650
It is. That's right.
Here he is.

170
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,690
You'd be happy, too.

171
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,550
Now, what's his net worth?
Anybody have any idea?

172
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,470
That's a big number.

173
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,570
During the Clinton years, remember
there was a controversy donors?

174
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,550
Big campaign contributors were
invited to stay overnight

175
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,810
in the Lincoln bedroom
at the White House?

176
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,180
I think if you've contributed
twenty five thousand dollars or above,

177
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:23,330
someone figured out at the median
contribution that got you invited

178
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,830
to stay a night in the
Lincoln bedroom,

179
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,770
Bill Gates could afford to stay in
the Lincoln bedroom every night

180
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:33,910
for the next sixty six
thousand years.

181
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:44,590
Somebody else figured out, how much
does he get paid on an hourly basis?

182
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:49,240
And so they figured out,
since he began Microsoft,

183
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:55,980
I suppose he worked, what 14
hours per day, reasonable guess,

184
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:04,520
and you calculate this net wealth,
it turns out that his rate of pay

185
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:13,400
is over 150 dollars,
not per hour, not per minute

186
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:17,370
150 dollars, more than
150 dollars per second

187
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:24,870
which means that if on
his way to the office,

188
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:30,330
Gates noticed a hundred
dollar bill on the street,

189
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,830
it wouldn't be worth his
time to stop and pick it up.

190
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,640
Now, most of you will say someone
that wealthy surely we can tax them

191
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:52,950
to meet the pressing needs of people
who lack in education or lack enough

192
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,030
to eat or lack decent housing.

193
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:00,240
They need it more than he does.

194
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:04,940
And if you were a utilitarian,
what would you do?

195
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,900
What tax policy would you have?

196
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,370
You'd redistribute in a flash,
wouldn't you?

197
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:19,100
Because you would know being a
good utilitarian that taking some,

198
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,490
a small amount, he'd scarcely
going to notice it,

199
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,700
but it will make a huge improvement
in the lives and in the welfare

200
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:27,880
of those at the bottom.

201
00:16:28,729 --> 00:16:37,590
But remember, the libertarian theory
says we can't just add up an

202
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:41,590
aggregate preferences and
satisfactions that way.

203
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,230
We have to respect persons and if he
earned that money fairly without

204
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:51,100
violating anybody else's rights in
accordance with the two principles

205
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,550
of justice in acquisition and
in justice in transfer,

206
00:16:54,849 --> 00:17:00,650
then it would be wrong, it would be
a form of coercion to take it away

207
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:05,830
Michael Jordan is not as
wealthy as Bill Gates but he did

208
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,920
pretty well for himself.

209
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,860
You wanna see Michael Jordan.
There he is.

210
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:19,620
His income alone in one year was
31 million dollars and then

211
00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:23,090
he made another 47 million dollars
in endorsements for a Nike

212
00:17:23,379 --> 00:17:25,500
and other companies.

213
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:30,850
So his income was, in
one year, $78 million.

214
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,580
To require him to pay, let's say,
a third of his earnings to

215
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:41,770
the government to support good causes
like food and health care and

216
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:46,990
housing and education for the poor,
that's coercion, that's unjust.

217
00:17:47,379 --> 00:17:50,490
That violates his rights.

218
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:57,130
And that's why redistribution
is wrong.

219
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,310
Now, how many agree with that argument,
agree with the libertarian argument

220
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:09,150
that redistribution for the sake of
trying to help the poor is wrong?

221
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,250
And how many disagree
with that argument?

222
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,510
All right, let's begin with
those who disagree.

223
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:26,390
What's wrong with the libertarian
case against redistribution?

224
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,680
Yes.

225
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:32,530
I think these people like
Michael Jordan have received

226
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,290
we're talking about working within
a society and they receive

227
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:39,530
a larger gift from the society and
they have a larger obligation

228
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:43,160
in return to give that through
redistribution, you know,

229
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,400
you can say that Michael Jordan
may work just as hard as some who works,

230
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:52,590
you know, doing laundry 12 hours,
14 hours a day, but he's receiving more.

231
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,950
I don't think it's fair to say that,
you know, it's all on him,

232
00:18:57,129 --> 00:19:00,060
on his, you know, inherent,
you know, hard work.

233
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,900
All right, let's hear from defenders
of libertarianism.

234
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,670
Why would it be wrong in principle
to tax the rich to help the poor?

235
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:10,870
Go ahead.

236
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,330
My name is Joe and I
collect skateboards.

237
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,170
I've since bought a
hundred skateboards.

238
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,220
I live in a society of
a hundred people.

239
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,360
I'm the only one with skateboards.

240
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,160
Suddenly, everyone decides
they want a skateboard.

241
00:19:22,389 --> 00:19:23,750
They come to my
house, they take my

242
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,970
they take 99 of
my skateboards.

243
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,780
I think that is unjust.

244
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:31,590
Now, I think in certain circumstances
it becomes necessary

245
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,520
to overlook that unjustness,
perhaps condone that injustice

246
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,760
as in the case of the cabin boy
being killed for food.

247
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:41,620
If people are on the verge of dying,
perhaps it is necessary to

248
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,660
overlook that injustice,
but I think it's important

249
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,170
to keep in mind that we're still
committing injustice

250
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:48,310
by taking people's
belongings or assets.

251
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,000
Are you saying that taxing
Michael Jordan, say,

252
00:19:51,200 --> 00:20:00,110
at a 33 percent tax rate for good
causes to feed the hungry is theft?

253
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:02,660
I think it's unjust.

254
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:07,310
Yes, I do believe it's theft but perhaps
it is necessary to condone that theft.

255
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:08,970
But it's theft.

256
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,330
Yes.

257
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,710
	
Why is it theft, Joe?

258
00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:21,020
Because --

259
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,600
Why is it like your
collection of skateboards?

260
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,780
It's theft because, or at least,
in my opinion and by

261
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:33,690
the libertarian opinion he earned that
money fairly and it belongs to him.

262
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,370
So to take it from him
is by definition theft.

263
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,120

All right, let's hear
if there is＃

264
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,260
Who wants to reply to Joe?
Yes, go ahead.

265
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,230
I don't think this is necessarily
a case in which you have 99 skateboards

266
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,760
and the government＃

267
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,560
or you have a hundred skateboards and
the government is taking 99 of them.

268
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,350
It's like you have more skateboards
than there are days in a year.

269
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:03,780
You have more skateboards that
you're going to be able to use

270
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:08,610
in your entire lifetime and the
government is taking part of those.

271
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,010
And I think that if you are operating
in a society in which

272
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:15,290
the government's not 每
in which the government doesn't

273
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,280
redistribute wealth, then that
allows for people to amass

274
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:22,900
so much wealth that people who
haven't started from this very

275
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,840
the equal footing in our hypothetical
situation, that doesn't exist

276
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:30,350
in our real society get undercut
for the rest of their lives.

277
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:35,070
So you're worried that if there isn't
some degree of redistribution

278
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,520
of some or left at the bottom,
there will be no genuine

279
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,430
equality of opportunity.

280
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:46,300
All right, the idea that
taxation is theft,

281
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:50,640
Nozick takes that point
one step further.

282
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:55,310
He agrees that it's theft.
He's more demanding than Joe.

283
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,960
Joe says it is theft, maybe in an
extreme case it's justified,

284
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:07,590
maybe a parent is justified in stealing
a loaf of bread to feed his

285
00:22:07,689 --> 00:22:09,470
or her hungry family.

286
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,220
So Joe I would say, what
would you call yourself,

287
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,600
a compassionate
quasi-libertarian?

288
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:20,920
Nozick says, if you
think about it,

289
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:26,200
taxation amounts to the
taking of earnings.

290
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:38,100
In other words, it means taking
the fruits of my labor.

291
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:44,510
But if the state has the right to take
my earning or the fruits of my labor,

292
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:53,570
isn't that morally the same as
according to the state the right

293
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:57,330
to claim a portion of my labor?

294
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:11,020
So taxation actually is morally
equivalent to forced labor

295
00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:17,470
because forced labor involves the
taking of my leisure, my time,

296
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:27,370
my efforts, just as taxation takes
the earnings that I make with my labor.

297
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:35,030
And so, for Nozick and
for the libertarians,

298
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:43,800
taxation for redistribution is theft,
as Joe says, but not only theft is

299
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:50,730
morally equivalent to laying claim to
certain hours of a person's

300
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:56,880
life and labor, so it's morally
equivalent to forced labor.

301
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,050
If the state has a right to
claim the fruits of my labor,

302
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:06,480
that implies that it really has
an entitlement to my labor itself.

303
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,170
And what is forced labor?

304
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:17,000
Forced labor, Nozick points
out, is what, is slavery,

305
00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:26,150
because if I don't have the right,
the sole right to my own labor,

306
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:31,160
then that's really to say that
the government or the

307
00:24:31,649 --> 00:24:35,760
political community is
a part owner in me.

308
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,590
And what does it mean for the
state to be a part owner in me?

309
00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:46,200
If you think about it,
it means that I'm a slave,

310
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,580
that I don't own myself.

311
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:55,560
So what this line of reasoning brings
us to is the fundamental principle

312
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,830
that underlies the libertarian
case for rights.

313
00:25:01,639 --> 00:25:03,630
What is that principle?

314
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,510
It's the idea that I own myself.

315
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,170
It's the idea of self possession
if you want to take right seriously.

316
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:18,310
If you don't want to just regard
people as collections of preferences,

317
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:27,330
the fundamental moral idea to which
you will be lead is the idea

318
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:31,870
that we are the owners or the
propietors of our own person,

319
00:25:32,939 --> 00:25:36,580
and that's why
utilitarianism goes wrong.

320
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,220
And that's why it's wrong to yank the
organs from that healthy patient.

321
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:47,390
You're acting as if that patient belongs
to you or to the community.

322
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,260
But we belong to ourselves.

323
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,280
And that's the same reason that
it's wrong to make laws

324
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,580
to protect us from ourselves or
to tell us how to live,

325
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:03,820
to tell us what virtues we
should be governed by,

326
00:26:04,669 --> 00:26:09,120
and that's also why it's wrong to tax
the rich to help the poor

327
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,760
even for good causes,
even to help those

328
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,870
who are displaced by
the Hurricane Katrina.

329
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,790
Ask them to give charity.

330
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:21,470
But if you tax them, it's
like forcing them to labor.

331
00:26:21,939 --> 00:26:25,840
Could you tell Michael Jordan he has
to skip the next week's games

332
00:26:25,939 --> 00:26:30,490
and go down to help the people
displaced by Hurricane Katrina?

333
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,420
Morally, it's the same.

334
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:38,640
So the stakes are very high.

335
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:45,010
So far we've heard some objections
to the libertarian argument.

336
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:49,320
But if you want to reject it,
you have to break in to

337
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:52,590
this chain of reasoning which
goes, taking my earnings

338
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:57,420
is like taking my labor,
but taking my labor

339
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,530
is making me a slave.

340
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:04,240
And if you disagree with
that, you must believe in

341
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,510
the principle of
self possession.

342
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,810
Those who disagree,
gather your objections

343
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:14,090
and we'll begin with
them next time.

344
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,490
Anyone like to take
up that point? Yes.

345
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:29,680
I feel like when you live in a
society, you'd give up that right.

346
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:33,440
I mean, technically, if I want to
personally go out and kill someone

347
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,580
because they offend me,
that is self possession.

348
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,990
Because I live in a society,
I cannot do that.

349
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:43,630
Victoria, are you questioning the
fundamental premise of self possession?

350
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,290
Yes. I think that you don't
really have self possession

351
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:50,530
if you choose to live in a society
because you cannot just discount

352
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,010
the people around you.

353
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,880
We were talking last time
about libertarianism.

354
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:00,950
I want to go back to the arguments
for and against

355
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,060
the redistribution of income.

356
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:10,510
But before we do that, just
one word about the minimal state,

357
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,350
Milton Friedman, the
libertarian economist,

358
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:19,700
he points out that many
of the functions that

359
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:24,610
we take for granted as properly
belonging to government don't.

360
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,230
They are paternalist.

361
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,370
One example he gives
is social security.

362
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:36,190
He says it's a good idea for people
to save for their retirement

363
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:40,660
during their earning years
but it's wrong.

364
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:48,120
It's a violation of people's liberty
for the government to force everyone

365
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:54,160
whether they want to or not to
put aside some earnings today

366
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:57,030
for the sake of their retirement.

367
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,080
If people want to take the chance
or if people want to live big today

368
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:07,300
and live a poor retirement,
that should be their choice.

369
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:11,580
They should be free to make those
judgments and take those risks.

370
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,100
So even social security would still
be at odds with the minimal state

371
00:29:17,379 --> 00:29:20,360
that Milton Friedman argued for.

372
00:29:21,429 --> 00:29:24,860
It sometimes thought that collective
goods like police protection

373
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:32,140
and fire protection will inevitably
create the problem of free riders

374
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,520
unless they're publicly provided.

375
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,780
But there are ways to
prevent free riders.

376
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,870
There are ways to restrict even
seemingly collective goods

377
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,910
like fire protection.

378
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,060
I read an article a while back
about a private fire company,

379
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,320
the Salem Fire Corporation,
in Arkansas.

380
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,160
You can sign up with the
Salem Fire Corporation,

381
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:05,340
pay a yearly subscription fee,
and if your house catches on fire,

382
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,250
they will come and
put out the fire.

383
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,950
But they won't put
out everybody's fire.

384
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:17,150
They will only put it out
if it's a fire in the home

385
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:21,330
of a subscriber or if it starts
to spread and to threaten

386
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,740
the home of a subscriber.

387
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,460
The newspaper article just told
the story of a home owner

388
00:30:27,699 --> 00:30:33,350
who had subscribed to this
company in the past but failed

389
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,170
to renew his subscription.

390
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,690
His house caught on fire.

391
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,490
The Salem Fire Corporation
showed up with its trucks

392
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,630
and watched the house burn,

393
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,390
just making sure that
it didn't spread.

394
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:49,830
The fire chief was asked, well,
he wasn't exactly the fire chief.

395
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,840
I guess he was the CEO.

396
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:56,390
He was asked how can you stand
by with fire equipment and allow

397
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,240
a person's home
to burn?

398
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:03,490
He replied, once we verified there
was no danger to a member's property,

399
00:31:03,699 --> 00:31:07,730
we had no choice but to back
off according to our rules.

400
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:11,060
If we responded to all fires, he said,
there would be no incentive

401
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,920
to subscribe.

402
00:31:13,649 --> 00:31:16,660
The homeowner in this case tried
to renew his subscription

403
00:31:16,889 --> 00:31:18,280
at the scene of the fire.

404
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:21,800
But the head of the company refused.

405
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:26,220
You can't wreck your car, he said,
and then buy insurance for it later.

406
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,450
So even public goods that
we take for granted

407
00:31:30,629 --> 00:31:32,860
that's being within the
proper province of government

408
00:31:33,139 --> 00:31:36,910
can many of them in
principle be isolated,

409
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:39,670
made exclusive to those who pay.

410
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,010
That's all to do with the
question of collective goods

411
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,240
and the libertarians injunction
against paternalism.

412
00:31:50,139 --> 00:31:54,580
But let's go back now to the
arguments about redistribution.

413
00:31:54,689 --> 00:32:02,640
Now, underlying the libertarian's
case for the minimal state

414
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:08,250
is a worry about coercion,
but what's wrong with coercion?

415
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,900
The libertarian
offers this answer:

416
00:32:14,379 --> 00:32:21,990
To coerce someone, to use some person
for the sake of the general welfare

417
00:32:23,629 --> 00:32:32,150
is wrong because it calls into question
the fundamental fact that we own ourselves

418
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:37,350
the fundamental moral fact of
self possession or self ownership.

419
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:45,870
The libertarian's argument against
redistribution begins with

420
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:48,560
this fundamental idea that
we own ourselves.

421
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:57,460
Nozick says that if the society
as a whole can go to Bill Gates

422
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:03,790
or go to Michael Jordan and
tax away a portion of their wealth,

423
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:10,340
what the society is really asserting
is a collective property right

424
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:16,080
in Bill Gates or
in Michael Jordan.

425
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:22,070
But that violates the fundamental
principle that we belong to ourselves.

426
00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:29,280
Now, we've already heard a number of
objections to the libertarian argument.

427
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:38,900
What I would like to do today is
to give the libertarians among us

428
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:45,030
a chance to answer the objections
that have been raised and some have been

429
00:33:45,129 --> 00:33:50,720
some have already identified themselves
and have agreed to come and make

430
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:54,590
the case for libertarianism
to reply to the objections

431
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,080
that have been raised.

432
00:33:56,649 --> 00:33:59,890
So raise your hand if you are
among the libertarians

433
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:05,200
who's prepared to stand up for the
theory and respond to the objections.

434
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:07,130
You are?

435
00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:08,150
Alex Harris.

436
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,590
Alex Harris, who's been
a star on the web blog.

437
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,500
All right, Alex, come here.

438
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,760
Stand up.
Come.

439
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,680
We'll create a libertarian
corner over here.

440
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:21,260
And who else?

441
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,950
Other libertarians who will join.
What's your name?

442
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:29,380
John.
John?

443
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,290
Sheffield.
John Sheffield.

444
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:33,200
Who else wants to join?

445
00:34:34,549 --> 00:34:37,870
Other brave libertarians who
are prepared to take on

446
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:40,560
Yes, what's your name?
Julia Rotto.

447
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:44,610
Julia Rotto.
Julia, come join us over there.

448
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:48,330
Now, while the 每
while team libertarian

449
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:55,430
Julie, John, Alex.

450
00:34:55,529 --> 00:34:58,300
While team libertarian is
gathering over there,

451
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,060
let me just summarize the main
objections that I've heard

452
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:05,410
in class and on the website.

453
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:13,330
Objection number one每
and here I'll come down to-

454
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,360
I wanna talk to team
libertarian over here.

455
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:21,760
So objection number one is that
the poor need the money more.

456
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:28,210
That's an obvious objection,
a lot more than -- thanks 每

457
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,740
than do Bill Gates
and Michael Jordan.

458
00:35:32,779 --> 00:35:40,260
Objection number two, it's not
really slavery to tax because

459
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:46,340
at least in a democratic society
it's not a slave holder.

460
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,790
It's congress.
It's a democratic〞

461
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,610
you're smiling,
Alex, already.

462
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:54,730
You're confident you can
reply to all of these?

463
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:00,450
So taxation by consent of the
governed is not coercive.

464
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:06,640
Third, some people have said don't
the successful like Gates

465
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,370
owe a debt to society for their success
that they repay by paying taxes.

466
00:36:11,779 --> 00:36:13,400
Who wants to respond
to the first one,

467
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,630
the poor need the
money more?

468
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:17,530
All right, and you're?
John.

469
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:20,750
John. All right, John,
what's the, here I'll hold it.

470
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,860
All right.
The poor need the money more.

471
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,330
That's quite obvious.
I could use the money.

472
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:29,240
You know, I certainly wouldn't
mind if Bill Gates give

473
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,300
me a million dollars.

474
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:31,980
I mean, I'd take a thousand.

475
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:36,080
But at some point you
have to understand that

476
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,020
the benefits of redistribution of
wealth don't justify the initial

477
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,870
violation of the property right.

478
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,470
If you look at the argument
the poor need the money more,

479
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,860
at no point in that argument
do you contradict the fact that

480
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,940
we've extrapolated from,
agreed upon principles

481
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,400
that people own themselves.

482
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:56,380
We've extrapolated that people have
property rights and so whether or not

483
00:36:56,609 --> 00:36:59,250
it would be a good thing
or a nice thing or even

484
00:36:59,529 --> 00:37:01,810
a necessary thing for the
survival of some people,

485
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:04,400
we don't see that that justifies
the violation of the right

486
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,410
that we've logically
extrapolated.

487
00:37:06,529 --> 00:37:07,240
Good. Okay.

488
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:10,430
And so that also, I mean,
there still exist this institution

489
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,750
of like individual philanthropy.

490
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,370
Milton Friedman makes
this argument-

491
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:17,690
All right, so Bill Gates can
give to charity if he wants to.

492
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:18,560
Right.

493
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:22,310
But it would still be
wrong to coerce him.

494
00:37:22,569 --> 00:37:23,750
Exactly.

495
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:25,630
To meet the needs of the poor.

496
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,020
Exactly.

497
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,860
Are the two of you
happy with that reply?

498
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,360
Anything to add?
All right, go ahead. Julie?

499
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,470
Julia, yes.
I think I can also add, it's okay.

500
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,860
I guess I could add that there's a
difference between needing something

501
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,300
and deserving something.

502
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,340
I mean, in an ideal society
everyone's needs would be met

503
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:48,230
but here we're arguing what do
we deserve as a society and, yeah.

504
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:53,220
And the poor don't deserve
don't deserve the benefits

505
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,230
that would flow from taxing
Michael Jordan to help them.

506
00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:00,880
Based on what we've covered
here I don't think you deserve

507
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,200
something like that.

508
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:05,050
All right, let me push you
a little bit on that, Julia.

509
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:11,090
The victims of Hurricane Katrina
are in desperate need of help.

510
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:17,540
Would you say that they don't
deserve help that would come

511
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:21,220
from the federal government
through taxation?

512
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,330
Okay, that's a difficult question.

513
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:30,030
I think this is a case where they need
help, not deserve it, but I think,

514
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:34,130
again, if you had a certain level of
requirements to meet sustenance,

515
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,920
you're gonna need help,
like, if you don't have food

516
00:38:36,029 --> 00:38:38,020
or a place to live,
that's a case of need.

517
00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:41,360
So need is one thing
and deserve is another.

518
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,330
Exactly.

519
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:46,010
All right.
Who would like to reply?

520
00:38:51,569 --> 00:38:52,720
Yes.

521
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,250
Going back to the first point
that you made about the

522
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,930
property rights of individual.

523
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,820
The property rights are established
and enforced by the government,

524
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:05,860
which is a democratic government,
and we have representatives

525
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,770
to enforce those rights.

526
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,040
If you live in a society that
operates under those rules,

527
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:16,940
then it should be up to the
government to decide how

528
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:22,740
those resources[inaudible]taxation
are distributed because it is

529
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,120
through the consent
of the government.

530
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,560
If you disagree with it,
you don't have to live

531
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:27,570
in that society
where that operates.

532
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,900
All right, good, so,
and tell me your name.

533
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,210
Raul.

534
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:34,850
Raul is pointing out, actually,
Raul is invoking point number two.

535
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,170
If the taxation is by the
consent of the governed,

536
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,930
it's not coerced.
It's legitimate.

537
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,870
Bill Gates and Michael Jordan
are citizens of the United States.

538
00:39:48,049 --> 00:39:52,130
They get to vote for congress.
They get to vote their

539
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:55,110
policy convictions just
like everybody else.

540
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,630
Who would like to take
that one on? John?

541
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:04,070
Basically, what the libertarians
are objecting to in this case is

542
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:06,470
the middle 80 percent deciding
what the top ten percent

543
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,010
are doing for the
bottom ten percent.

544
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,640
Wait, wait, wait, John.
Majority.

545
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,190
Don't you believe in democracy?

546
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,380
Well, right, but at some point --

547
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,050
Don't you believe in,
I mean, you say 80 percent,

548
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:18,450
10 percent majority.
Majority rule is what?

549
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:19,820
The majority.

550
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,730
Exactly, but --

551
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,930
In a democracy.
Aren't you for democracy?

552
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,300
Yes, I'm for democracy, but

553
00:40:25,529 --> 00:40:26,630
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

554
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,590
Democracy and mob rule
aren't the same thing.

555
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,030
Mob rule?

556
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,550
Mob rule, exactly.

557
00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:34,160
In an open society you have
a recourse to address that

558
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,650
through your representatives.

559
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:39,590
And if the majority of the consent
of those who are governed

560
00:40:39,799 --> 00:40:42,100
doesn't agree with you,
then you know,

561
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:46,460
you're choosing to live in a
society and you have to operate

562
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:49,200
under what the majority
the society concludes.

563
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,640
All right, Alex,
on democracy.

564
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:53,020
What about that?

565
00:40:53,299 --> 00:40:56,360
The fact that I have one, you
know, five hundred thousandth

566
00:40:56,770 --> 00:41:00,090
of the vote for one representative
in congress is not the same thing

567
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:04,330
as my having the ability to
decide for myself how

568
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:05,770
to use my property rights.

569
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:09,940
I'm a drop in the bucket
and, you know, well --

570
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,300
You might lose the vote.

571
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,550
Exactly.

572
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:13,420
And they might take --

573
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,250
And I will.
I mean,

574
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,520
I don't have the decision
right now of whether or not

575
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,360
to pay taxes.

576
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,360
If I don't, I get locked in jail or they
tell me to get out of the country.

577
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:27,360
But, Alex, Alex, let me make
a small case for democracy.

578
00:41:27,549 --> 00:41:30,010
And see what you would say.

579
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:33,350
Why can't you, we live in a
democratic society with

580
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,710
freedom of speech.

581
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:40,220
Why can't you take to the Hustings,
persuade your fellow citizens

582
00:41:40,549 --> 00:41:44,110
that taxation is unjust
and try to get a majority?

583
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,430
I don't think that people
should be, should have to

584
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,360
convince 280 million others
simply in order to exercise

585
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,150
their own rights, in order to not
have their self ownership violated.

586
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,050
I think people should be able
to do that without having

587
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:58,560
to convince 280 million people.

588
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,620
Does that mean you are
against democracy as a whole?

589
00:42:00,799 --> 00:42:01,590
I -- no.

590
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,910
I just believe in a very
limited form of democracy

591
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:07,570
whereby we have a constitution
that severely limits the scope

592
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:10,370
of what decisions can
be made democratically.

593
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:13,660
All right, so you're saying
that democracy is fine

594
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,220
except where fundamental
rights are involved.

595
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:17,290
Yes.

596
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:20,060
And I think you could win.

597
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:23,370
If you're going on the Hustings,
let me add one element

598
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,990
to the argument
you might make.

599
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:30,500
You can say put aside the
economic debates, taxation.

600
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:34,140
Suppose the individual right
to religious liberty were

601
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:38,550
at stake, then, Alex, you
could say, on the Hustings.

602
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:42,310
Surely, you would all agree that
we shouldn't put the right to

603
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,410
individual liberty up to a vote.

604
00:42:45,549 --> 00:42:50,230
Yeah, that's exactly right,
and that's why we have a

605
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,250
constitutional amendments.

606
00:42:51,529 --> 00:42:53,340
and why do we make it so hard
to amend our constitution.

607
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:57,040
So you would say that the
right to private property,

608
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,940
the right of Michael Jordan to
keep all the money he makes

609
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,510
at least to protect it from
redistribution is the same

610
00:43:05,609 --> 00:43:10,190
kind of right with the same
kind of weight as the right

611
00:43:10,279 --> 00:43:13,520
to freedom of speech,
the right to religious liberty,

612
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,790
rights that should trump
what the majority wants.

613
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,070
Absolutely.

614
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:20,160
The reason why we have a right
to free speech is because

615
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:23,740
we have a right to own ourselves,
to exercise our voice

616
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,810
in any way that we choose.

617
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,060
All right, good.

618
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:28,570
All right, so there we〞

619
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:31,080
All right, who would like to
respond to that argument

620
00:43:31,339 --> 00:43:36,020
about democracy being-
Okay, up there. Stand up.

621
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:41,220
I think comparing religion
economics it's not the same thing.

622
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,410
The reason why Bill Gates is able
to make so much money is because

623
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,140
we live in an economically and
socially stable society.

624
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,480
And if the government didn't provide
for the poor as ten percent

625
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:55,480
as you say through taxation,
then we would need more money

626
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,820
for police to prevent crime
and so, either way,

627
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,330
there would be more taxes
taken away to provide

628
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:06,010
what you guys call the necessary
things that the government provides.

629
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:06,900
What's your name?

630
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,650
Anna.

631
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:10,240
Anna, let me ask you this.

632
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:17,240
Why is the fundamental right
to religious liberty different

633
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,720
from the right Alex asserts
as a fundamental right

634
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:27,080
to private property and to
keep what I earn?

635
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:29,230
What's the difference
between the two?

636
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:31,420
Because you wouldn't have-

637
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:35,730
You wouldn't be able to make money,
you wouldn't be able to own property

638
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:39,150
if there wasn't that socially,
like, if society wasn't stable,

639
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,770
and that's completely
different from religion.

640
00:44:42,049 --> 00:44:44,380
That's like something personal,
something that you can practice

641
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,400
on your own in your own home
or like me practicing my religion

642
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:49,760
is not going to affect
the next person.

643
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:52,160
But if I'm poor and
I'm desperate,

644
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:57,180
like I might commit a crime to feed
my family and that can affect others.

645
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,540
Okay, good, thank you.

646
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:04,520
Would it be wrong for someone
to steal a loaf of bread

647
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:09,120
to feed his starving family?
Is that wrong?

648
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,310
I believe that it is.
This is --

649
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:14,000
Let's take a quick poll
of the three of you.

650
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:15,570
You say, yes, it is wrong.
Yes.

651
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:16,510
John?

652
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:17,950
It violates property rights.
It's wrong.

653
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,690
Even to save a starving family?

654
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:23,720
I mean there are definitely
other ways around that

655
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:27,120
and by justifying, no,
hang on, hang on,

656
00:45:27,299 --> 00:45:28,270
before you laugh at me.

657
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:37,420
Before justifying the
act of stealing,

658
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:41,740
you have to look at violating the right
that we've already agreed exists,

659
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:45,230
the right of self possession and
the possession of, I mean,

660
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:46,110
your own things.

661
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,390
We agree on property rights.

662
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,330
All right, we
agree at stealing.

663
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:49,320
Yeah, we agree at stealing.

664
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,370
So property rights
is not the issue.

665
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,200
All right, but --

666
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,760
So why is it wrong to steal
even to feed your starving family?

667
00:45:54,859 --> 00:45:58,230
Sort of the original argument
that I made in the very first

668
00:45:58,330 --> 00:45:59,070
question you asked.

669
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:04,360
The benefits of an action don't
justify, don't make the action just.

670
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:06,690
Do what, what would
you say, Julia?

671
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,440
Is it all right to steal a
loaf of bread to feed a

672
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:15,420
starving family or to steal a drug
that your child needs to survive?

673
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:19,670
I think, I'm okay with
that, honestly.

674
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:21,400
Even from the
libertarian standpoint,

675
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:24,510
I think that, okay, saying
that you can just take money

676
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,620
arbitrarily from people who
have a lot to go to this pool

677
00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:29,760
of people who need it,
but you have an individual

678
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,880
who's acting on their own behalf
to kind of save themselves and then

679
00:46:34,089 --> 00:46:36,730
I think you said they, for
any idea like self possession,

680
00:46:37,379 --> 00:46:39,730
they are also in charge of protecting
themselves and keeping themselves

681
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,820
alive so, therefore, even for
a libertarian standpoint,

682
00:46:43,049 --> 00:46:44,100
that might be okay.

683
00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:45,830
All right, that's good,
that's good.

684
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,570
All right, what about
number three up here?

685
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:52,330
Isn't it the case that
the successful,

686
00:46:52,529 --> 00:46:55,070
the wealthy, owe a debt.

687
00:46:55,299 --> 00:46:56,640
They didn't do that
all by themselves.

688
00:46:56,839 --> 00:47:01,420
They had to cooperate with other
people that they owe a debt

689
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,210
to society and that that's
expressed in taxation.

690
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:05,390
You wanna take that on, Julia?

691
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:09,700
Okay, this one, I believe
that there is not a debt to society

692
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:11,870
in the sense that how did
these people become wealthy?

693
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,010
They did something that
society valued highly.

694
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:18,140
I think that society has already
been giving, been providing for them

695
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:21,640
if anything, I think it's＃
everything is cancelled out.

696
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,860
They provided a service to society
and society responded by somehow

697
00:47:26,069 --> 00:47:27,480
they got their wealth,
so I think that --

698
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,480
So be concrete.

699
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:31,480
In the case of Michael Jordan, some＃

700
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:33,680
I mean, to illustrate your point.

701
00:47:33,859 --> 00:47:37,160
There were people who helped him
make the money, the teammates,

702
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:40,260
the coach, people who
taught him how to play.

703
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:44,810
But they've, you're saying, but they've
all been paid for their services.

704
00:47:45,009 --> 00:47:48,670
Exactly, and society derived a lot
of benefit and pleasure from watching

705
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:49,980
Michael Jordan play.

706
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:53,320
I think that that's how
he paid his debt to society.

707
00:47:53,549 --> 00:47:54,520
All right, good.

708
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:57,390
Who would, anyone likes
to take up that point? Yes.

709
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:03,010
I think that there's a problem
here with that we're assuming

710
00:48:03,299 --> 00:48:06,540
that a person has self possession
when they live in a society.

711
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,520
I feel like when you live in a
society, you give up that right.

712
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:13,390
I mean, technically, if I want to
personally go out and kill someone

713
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,190
because they offend me,
that is self possession.

714
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,860
Because I live in a society
I cannot do that.

715
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:21,610
I think it's kind of equivalent to
say because I have more money,

716
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:23,750
I have resources that
can save people's lives,

717
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,680
is it not okay for the government
to take that from me?

718
00:48:26,859 --> 00:48:30,340
Self possession only to a certain
extent because I'm living in a society

719
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,660
where I have to take account
of the people around me.

720
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:34,100
So are you question,
what's your name?

721
00:48:34,299 --> 00:48:35,300
Victoria.

722
00:48:35,509 --> 00:48:40,610
Victoria, are you questioning the
fundamental premise of self possession?

723
00:48:40,779 --> 00:48:41,910
Yes.

724
00:48:42,509 --> 00:48:44,450
I think that you don't really
have self possession

725
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:47,480
if you choose to live in a society
because you cannot just discount

726
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:49,100
the people around you.

727
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:54,400
All right, I want to quickly get
the response of the libertarian

728
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,780
team to the last point.

729
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,330
The last point builds on, well,
maybe it builds on Victoria's

730
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:08,240
suggestion that we don't own ourselves
because it says that Bill Gates

731
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:13,100
is wealthy, that Michael Jordan
makes a huge income,

732
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:17,330
isn't wholly their own doing.

733
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:20,910
It's the product of a lot of luck
and so we can't claim that they

734
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:24,670
morally deserve all
the money they make.

735
00:49:24,819 --> 00:49:26,340
Who wants to reply to that?
Alex?

736
00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:30,660
You certainly could make
the case that it is not＃

737
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:33,400
their wealth is not appropriate
to the goodness in their hearts,

738
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,190
but that's not really the
morally relevant issue.

739
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:39,670
The point is that they have
received what they have through

740
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:43,530
the free exchange of people
who have given them their holdings,

741
00:49:43,759 --> 00:49:46,040
usually in exchange for
providing some other service

742
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:47,140
Good enough.

743
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:50,480
I want to try to sum up what
we've learned from this discussion,

744
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:55,740
but, first, let's thank John, Alex,
and Julia for a really wonderful job.

745
00:50:02,569 --> 00:50:07,020
Toward the end of the discussion
just now Victoria challenged

746
00:50:07,819 --> 00:50:11,480
the premise of this line of
reasoning that's libertarian logic.

747
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:16,820
Maybe, she suggested, we don't
own ourselves after all.

748
00:50:18,509 --> 00:50:24,130
If you reject the libertarian
case against redistribution,

749
00:50:25,509 --> 00:50:32,620
there would seem to be an incentive
to break in to the libertarian line

750
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:38,130
of reasoning at the earliest,
at the most modest level,

751
00:50:38,879 --> 00:50:43,140
which is why a lot of people
disputed that taxation

752
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:46,040
is morally equivalent
to forced labor.

753
00:50:47,399 --> 00:50:55,060
But what about the big claim,
the premise, the big idea

754
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,990
underlying the
libertarian argument?

755
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:04,330
Is it true that we own ourselves
or can we do without that idea

756
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:13,820
and still avoid what libertarians
want to avoid creating a society

757
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:20,920
in an account of justice where
some people can be just used

758
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:28,390
for the sake of other people's welfare
or even for the sake of the general good?

759
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:37,580
Libertarians combat the utilitarian
idea of using people as means

760
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:41,870
for the collective happiness by
saying the way to put a stop

761
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:47,580
to that utilitarian logic of
using persons is to resort to

762
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:52,320
the intuitively powerful idea
that we are the proprietors

763
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:54,350
of our own person.

764
00:51:57,069 --> 00:52:00,730
That's Alex and Julia and
John and Robert Nozick.

765
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:07,910
What are the consequences
for a theory of justice

766
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,730
and in account of rights
of calling into question

767
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:13,810
the idea of self possession?

768
00:52:15,819 --> 00:52:19,430
Does it mean that we're back to
utilitarianism and using people

769
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:23,200
and aggregating preferences and
pushing the fat man off the bridge?

770
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:35,810
Nozick doesn't himself fully develop
the idea of self possession.

771
00:52:35,879 --> 00:52:38,840
He borrows it from an
earlier philosopher, John Locke.

772
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:48,090
John Locke accounted for the rise
of private property from the state

773
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:53,260
of nature by a chain of reasoning
very similar to the one that Nozick

774
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:55,060
and the libertarians use.

775
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:06,060
John Locke said private property arises
because when we mix our labor with things,

776
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:12,570
unowned things, we come to aquire
a property right in those things.

777
00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:15,300

And the reason?

778
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:18,180
The reason is that we
own our own labor,

779
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:20,140
and the reason for that?

780
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:24,920
We are the proprietors, the
owners of our own person.

781
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:32,860
And so in order to examine the
moral force of the libertarian claim

782
00:53:33,089 --> 00:53:37,400
that we own ourselves,
we need to turn to

783
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:42,160
the English political philosopher,
John Locke, and examine his account

784
00:53:42,569 --> 00:53:47,540
of private property and self ownership
and that's what we'll do next time.
