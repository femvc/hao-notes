THE GOOD CITIZEN

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,140
We turn to Aristotle

3
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,150
after examining theories,

4
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,980
modern theories, of justice

5
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,870
that try to detach

6
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,050
considerations of
justice and rights

7
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,630
from questions of
moral desert and virtue.

8
00:00:55,589 --> 00:01:00,660
Aristotle disagrees
with Kant and Rawls.

9
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,940
Aristotle argues that justice is a matter
of giving people what they deserve.

10
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,020
And the central idea of
Aristotle's theory of justice

11
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,500
is that in reasoning
about justice and rights

12
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,770
we have,
unavoidably,

13
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,310
to reason about the purpose,
or the end, or the telos,

14
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,660
of social practices in institutions.

15
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,410
Yes, justice requires giving equal things
to equal persons,

16
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,430
but the question immediately arises,
in any debate about justice,

17
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,070
equal in what respect?

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,960
And Aristotle says we need to fill in
the answer to that question

19
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:51,380
by looking to the
characteristic end,

20
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,540
or the essential nature,

21
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,560
or the purpose,
of the thing we're distributing.

22
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,260
And so we discussed
Aristotle's example of flutes;

23
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,980
who should get the best flutes.

24
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,140
And Aristotle's answer was
the best flute-players.

25
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,060
The best flute-player
should get the best flute

26
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,960
because that's the way
of honoring

27
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,060
the excellence

28
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:19,680
of flute playing.

29
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:26,320
It's a way of rewarding the virtue
of the great flute-player.

30
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,700
What's interesting though,

31
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,900
and this is what we are
going to explore today,

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,660
is that it's not quite so easy
to dispense with teleological reasoning

33
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,960
when we're thinking
about social institutions

34
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,360
and political practices.

35
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,000
In general it's hard
to do without teleology

36
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,640
when we're thinking about
ethics, justice, and moral argument.

37
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:02,700
At least that is Aristotle's claim.

38
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,360
And I would like to bring out
the force in Aristotle's claim

39
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:08,340
by considering two examples.

40
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,060
One is an example that Aristotle
spends quite a bit of time discussing;

41
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,220
the case of politics.

42
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,420
How should political offices
and honors,

43
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,010
how should political rule
be distributed?

44
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:29,260
The second example is a
contemporary debate about golf

45
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,500
and whether the
Professional Golfers Association

46
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,140
should be required
to allow Casey Martin,

47
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,220
a golfer with a disability,

48
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,190
to ride in a golf cart.

49
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,570
Both cases
bring out

50
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,810
a further feature

51
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,170
of Aristotle's teleological way
of thinking about justice.

52
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,860
And that is that when we attend
to the telos, or the purpose,

53
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,830
sometimes we disagree and argue
about what the purpose

54
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,010
of a social practice
really consists in.

55
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:13,220
And when we have
those disagreements

56
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,860
part of what's at stake
in those disagreements

57
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:20,310
is not just who will get what,

58
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,120
not just a distributive question,

59
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,300
but also an honorific question.

60
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,820
What qualities,
what excellences,

61
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,670
of persons
will be honored?

62
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,420
Debates about
purpose and telos

63
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,450
are often, simultaneously,
debates about honor.

64
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,380
Now, let's see
how that works

65
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,930
in the case of Aristotle's
account of politics.

66
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,060
When we discuss
distributive justice these days

67
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:05,060
we're mainly concerned with the distribution
of income and wealth and opportunity.

68
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,420
Aristotle took
distributive justice

69
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:12,260
to be mainly not
about income and wealth

70
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,960
but about offices and honors.

71
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,240
Who should have
the right to rule?

72
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,770
Who should be a citizen?

73
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,830
How should political authority
be distributed?

74
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,900
Those were his questions.

75
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,510
How did he go about
answering those questions?

76
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:34,190
Well, in line with his
teleological account of justice,

77
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,180
Aristotle argues that to know how
political authority should be distributed

78
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,620
we have, first, to inquire
into the purpose, the point,

79
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,010
the telos,
of politics.

80
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,250
So, what is politics about?

81
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,320
And, how does this help us
decide who should rule?

82
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,540
Well, for Aristotle the answer
to that question is,

83
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,860
politics is about

84
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:04,300
forming character,

85
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,530
forming good character.

86
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:09,870
It's about cultivating
the virtue of citizens.

87
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,590
It's about the good life.

88
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,540
The end of the State,
the end of the political community,

89
00:06:17,859 --> 00:06:20,500
he tells us in
Book Three of the Politics,

90
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,980
is not mere life,
it's not economic exchange only,

91
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:28,860
it's not security only,

92
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,860
it's realizing the good life.

93
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,540
That's what politics is for
according to Aristotle.

94
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,180
Now, you might worry about this.

95
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:44,660
You might say, "Well, maybe this shows us
why those modern theorists of justice,

96
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,340
and of politics,

97
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:48,820
are right".

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,770
Because remember,
for Kant and for Rawls,

99
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,940
the point of politics is not to shape
the moral character of citizens.

100
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,340
It's not to make us good.

101
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,790
It's to respect our freedom
to choose our goods,

102
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,540
our values,
our ends,

103
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,820
consistent with
a similar liberty for others.

104
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,110
Aristotle disagrees.

105
00:07:14,989 --> 00:07:16,900
"Any polis which is truly so called,

106
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,250
and is not merely one in name,

107
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,960
must devote itself to the end
of encouraging goodness.

108
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:28,270
Otherwise political association
sinks into a mere alliance.

109
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,910
Law becomes a mere covenant,

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,990
a guarantor of man's rights
against one another,

111
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,540
instead of being -
as it should be -

112
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,420
a way of life such as will make
the members of a polis good and just."

113
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,860
That's Aristotle's view.

114
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,290
"A polis is not an association
for residents on a common site,

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,940
or for the sake of
preventing mutual injustice

116
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,540
and easing exchange."
Aristotle writes.

117
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,900
"The end and purpose
of a polis is the good life,

118
00:07:56,239 --> 00:08:00,400
and the institutions of social life
are means to that end."

119
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:06,110
Now, if that's the purpose of politics,
of the polis,

120
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:10,920
then, Aristotle says,
we can derive from that

121
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,400
the principles of
distributive justice;

122
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,500
the principles that tell us
who should have the greatest say,

123
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:21,020
who should have the greatest measure
of political authority.

124
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,780
And what's his answer
to that question?

125
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,290
Well, those who contribute the most

126
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,610
to an association of this character,

127
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,910
namely an association
that aims at the good,

128
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:40,420
should have a greater share in political rule
and in the honors of the polis.

129
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,270
And the reasoning is,

130
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,080
they are in a position
to contribute most

131
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,970
to what political community
is essentially about.

132
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,720
Well, so you can see
the link that he draws

133
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:04,420
between the principle of distribution
for citizenship and political authority

134
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,980
and the purpose of politics.

135
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,900
"But why,"
you'll quickly ask,

136
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,220
"Why does he claim

137
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,500
that political life,
participation in politics,

138
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,820
is somehow essential

139
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,460
to living a good life?"

140
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,180
"Why isn't it possible

141
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,980
for people to live
perfectly good lives,

142
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:28,500
decent lives,
moral lives,

143
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,060
without participating in politics?"

144
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,840
Well, he gives two answers
to that question.

145
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,680
He gives a partial answer,
a preliminary answer,

146
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,340
in Book One of the Politics

147
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,620
where he tells us
that only by living in a polis,

148
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,700
and participating in politics,

149
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,740
do we fully realize our nature
as human beings.

150
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,620
Human beings are,
by nature,

151
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:05,420
meant to live in a polis.

152
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:07,320
Why?

153
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,990
It's only in political life
that we can actually exercise

154
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,810
our distinctly human capacity
for language,

155
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,690
which Aristotle understands is this capacity
to deliberate about right and wrong,

156
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:24,640
the just and the unjust.

157
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:28,700
And so, Aristotle writes
in Book One of the Politics,

158
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:31,990
that the polis,
the political community,

159
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,410
exists by nature
and is prior to the individual.

160
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,550
Not prior in time,

161
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:40,420
but prior in its purpose.

162
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,380
Human beings
are not self-sufficient,

163
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,890
living by themselves,

164
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,700
outside a political community.

165
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,450
"Man who is isolated, who is unable to share
in the benefits of political association,

166
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:57,010
or who has no need to share,

167
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,980
because he's already self-sufficient,

168
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,990
such a person must be
either a beast or a god."

169
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,970
So we only fully
realize our nature,

170
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,340
we only fully unfold
our human capacities,

171
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,580
when we exercise our
faculty of language,

172
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,740
which means when we deliberate
with our fellow citizens

173
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,540
about good and evil,

174
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,130
right and wrong,
just and the unjust.

175
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:37,420
"But why can we only exercise our capacity
for language in political community?"

176
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,140
you might ask.

177
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:45,220
Aristotle gives a second part,
a fuller part,

178
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,860
of his answer in the
Nichomachean Ethics;

179
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:53,490
an excerpt of which
we have among the readings.

180
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:01,660
And there he explains
that political deliberation,

181
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,190
living the life of a citizen,

182
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,020
ruling and being ruled in turn,
sharing in rule,

183
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,860
all of this is necessary to virtue.

184
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:20,970
Aristotle defines happiness

185
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,890
not as maximizing the balance
of pleasure over pain

186
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,740
but as an activity,
an activity of the soul

187
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,100
in accordance with virtue.

188
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,180
And he says that every student
of politics must study the soul

189
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,430
because shaping the soul
is one of the objects of legislation

190
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,780
in a good city.

191
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,340
But why is it necessary
to live in a good city

192
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:56,020
in order to live
a virtuous life?

193
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,220
Why can't we just learn
good moral principles at home

194
00:13:02,969 --> 00:13:05,040
or in a philosophy class
or from a book,

195
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,820
live according to those principles,

196
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,420
those rules,
those precepts,

197
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,380
and leave it at that?

198
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,340
Aristotle says virtue
isn't acquired that way.

199
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,980
Virtue

200
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,850
is only something
we can acquire by practicing,

201
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,250
by exercising the virtues.

202
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,420
It's the kind of thing
we can only learn by doing.

203
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,690
It doesn't come
from book learning.

204
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:41,220
In this respect,
it's like flute playing;

205
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,780
you couldn't learn how to play
a musical instrument well

206
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:46,830
just by reading a book about it.

207
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,660
You have to practice,

208
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:51,900
and you have to listen
to other accomplished flute-players.

209
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,510
There are other practices
and skills of this type.

210
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,410
Cooking;

211
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,870
there are cookbooks

212
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,020
but no great chef ever learns how to cook
by reading a cookbook only.

213
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:07,290
It's the kind of thing
you only learn by doing.

214
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,430
Joke-telling is probably
another example of this kind.

215
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,530
No great comedian learns to be a comedian
just by reading a book

216
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:18,300
on the principles of comedy.

217
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,900
It wouldn't work.

218
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,180
Now, why not?

219
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,690
What do joke-telling
and cooking

220
00:14:24,939 --> 00:14:27,820
and playing a musical instrument
have in common

221
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,250
such that we can't learn them
just by grasping a precept or a rule

222
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:35,890
that we might learn
from a book or a lecture?

223
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,100
What they have in common is
that they are all concerned with

224
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:43,520
getting the hang of it.

225
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,580
But also what is it we get the hang of
when we learn how to cook,

226
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,380
or play a musical instrument,
or tell jokes well?

227
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:56,180
Discerning particulars,
particular features of a situation.

228
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:58,780
And no rule,
no precept,

229
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:04,470
could tell the comedian or the cook
or the great musician

230
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,910
how to get in the habit of,
the practice of,

231
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:17,030
discerning the particular features
of a situation.

232
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,060
Aristotle says virtue
is that way too.

233
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,700
Now, how does this
connect to politics?

234
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:31,500
The only way we can acquire the virtues
that constitute the good life

235
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:39,190
is to exercise the virtues,
to have certain habits inculcated in us,

236
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:45,420
and then to engage in the practice
of deliberating with citizens

237
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,060
about the nature of the good.

238
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:50,860
That's what politics
is ultimately about.

239
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,900
The acquisition of civic virtue,

240
00:15:57,069 --> 00:16:00,940
of this capacity
to deliberate among equals,

241
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:05,700
that's something we couldn't get
living a life alone outside of politics.

242
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,560
And so, that's why,
in order to realize our nature,

243
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,810
we have to engage in politics.

244
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,900
And that's why those
who are greatest in civic virtue,

245
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,790
like Pericles,
are the ones

246
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:26,180
who properly have the greatest measure
of offices and honors.

247
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,930
So, the argument about the
distribution of offices and honors

248
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,700
has this teleological character,

249
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,600
but also an honorific dimension.

250
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,560
Because part of the point of politics
is to honor people like Pericles.

251
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,070
It isn't just that Pericles
should have the dominant say

252
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,030
because he has
the best judgment,

253
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,860
and that will lead to
the best outcomes,

254
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,900
to the best consequences
for the citizens.

255
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,100
That's true,
and that's important.

256
00:17:01,469 --> 00:17:04,840
But a further reason
people like Pericles

257
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,030
should have
the greatest measure

258
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,820
of offices, and honors,
and political authority,

259
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,220
and sway in the polis,

260
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,420
is that part of the point of politics
is to single out and honor

261
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:21,420
those who posses
the relevant virtue,

262
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:24,380
in this case civic virtue,
civic excellence, practical wisdom,

263
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,590
to the fullest extent.

264
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,550
That's the honorific dimension

265
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,260
bound up with Aristotle's
account of politics.

266
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,260
Here's an example

267
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,700
that shows the link

268
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,790
in a contemporary controversy;

269
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,150
the link to which Aristotle
draws our attention

270
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:54,340
between arguments about
justice and rights on the one hand

271
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,940
and figuring out the telos or the purpose
of a social practice on the other.

272
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,840
Not only that, the case of
Casey Martin and his golf cart

273
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,420
also brings out
the link between

274
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,540
debates about
what the purpose

275
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,700
of a social practice
or a game

276
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:16,980
is, on the one hand

277
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,940
and the question of what qualities
should be honored on the other;

278
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,260
the link between teleology

279
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:28,820
and honor-based

280
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,040
principles of distributive justice.

281
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,760
Who was Casey Martin?

282
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,500
Well, Casey Martin
is a very good golfer.

283
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,290
Able to compete
at the highest levels of golf

284
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,300
but for one thing;

285
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,900
he has a rare

286
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,000
circulatory problem in his leg

287
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:52,300
that makes it very difficult
for him to walk;

288
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,400
not only difficult but dangerous.

289
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,900
And so he asked the PGA,

290
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,440
which governs the pro tour in golf,

291
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,220
to be able to use a golf cart

292
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,940
when he competed in
professional tournaments.

293
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,780
PGA said no,

294
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,540
and he sued under the
Americans for Disabilities Act;

295
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:23,580
he sued in a case that went all the way
to the United States Supreme Court.

296
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,700
The question the Supreme Court
had to answer was,

297
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:34,100
does Casey Martin have a right

298
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:37,620
that the PGA provide him,
allow him,

299
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,460
to use a golf cart on the tour,

300
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,300
or not?

301
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,160
How many here

302
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,940
think that,

303
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,140
from a moral point of view,

304
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,660
Casey Martin should

305
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,300
have a right to
use a golf cart?

306
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,660
And how many think that he should not
have a right to a golf cart,

307
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,100
in the tournaments?

308
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,780
So the majority are sympathetic
to Casey Martin's right,

309
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,020
though a substantial minority disagree.

310
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:18,900
Let's first hear from those of you

311
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,700
who would rule against Casey Martin.

312
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,100
Why would you not say that
the PGA must give him a golf cart?

313
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,780
Yes.

314
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,620
Since the inception of golf,

315
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:37,140
because it has been part of the sport

316
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:40,170
it is now intrinsically part of golf;

317
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,660
walking the course.

318
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:43,420
And thus,
because it's intrinsic to golf,

319
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,220
I'd argue that not being able
to walk the course

320
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,660
is just not being able to perform
an aspect of the sport,

321
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,940
which is necessary to performing
at a professional level.

322
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:54,540
Good.
Stay there for a minute.

323
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,420
What's your name?

324
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,420
Tommy.

325
00:20:56,679 --> 00:20:57,940
Are you a golfer,
by the way, Tom?

326
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,300
Not so much but, yeah,

327
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,100
a little bit.

328
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,340
Are there any golfers
here,

329
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,660
I mean, real golfers?

330
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,700
Thank you, professor,
that was...

331
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,820
No, no.

332
00:21:10,879 --> 00:21:11,980
I'm just taking your word for it.

333
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,020
Is there someone here
on the golf team?

334
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,660
Yes?

335
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,780
Tell us your name,

336
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,960
and tell us what you think.

337
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,740
My name is Michael

338
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,740
and I usually take a cart.

339
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,900
So . . .

340
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:34,820
I'm probably the wrong
person to ask.

341
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:38,380
Is that why your hand
went up slowly when I asked?

342
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:39,460
Yes.

343
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,600
Alright, but Tom is saying,

344
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,060
Tom said a minute ago
that at least at the professional level

345
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,580
walking the course is
essential to the game.

346
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:53,580
Do you agree?

347
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,740
I would, yes.

348
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,460
You do?
Then why do you take a cart?

349
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,900
And you call yourself
a golfer?

350
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,780
No, no, no.

351
00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:02,900
I'm kidding,
I'm kidding.

352
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,540
What do you say to that?

353
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,900
When I have walked the course

354
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:08,780
it does add tremendously to the game.

355
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,820
It makes it a lot harder.
It really does.

356
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,090
Yeah?

357
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,340
Alright let's hear,
Michael and Tom stay there,

358
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:18,740
let's hear from people who

359
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,780
say that he should have
a right to a golf cart.

360
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,300
Why? Who is prepared
to defend that position?

361
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:28,820
Yes.

362
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,460
Well, I think the PGA
should definitely

363
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,380
be required to give
him a golf cart

364
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,440
because they argue in the decision
that it's not just a matter of,

365
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,780
he's not experiencing fatigue.

366
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,620
For him he's still walking
about a mile,

367
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,540
the cart can't go
everywhere with him,

368
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:46,620
and in that mile he is still experiencing
more fatigue and pain

369
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,620
than a healthy player would.

370
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,340
So, it's not as if you're
removing the disadvantage.

371
00:22:51,689 --> 00:22:52,900
What's your name?

372
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:53,860
Riva.

373
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,180
Riva, what do you say
to Tom's point

374
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,590
that walking the course
is essential to the game?

375
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,500
It would be as if

376
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:04,490
a disabled player could
play in the NBA

377
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,340
but not have to run
up and down the court.

378
00:23:09,379 --> 00:23:12,260
Well, I think there are
two responses to that.

379
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,620
First, I don't think it's
essential to the game,

380
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,060
because most golfers who play,
particularly recreationally,

381
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,070
play with a cart.
-- Like Michael.

382
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,820
And on several of the tours

383
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,560
you can play with a cart;

384
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,990
on the Senior PGA Tour,

385
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,220
on the Nike Tour,

386
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,020
in a lot of the college events.

387
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,520
And those events
are just as competitive

388
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,940
and just as high level
as the PGA Tour.

389
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,660
So, really it's just a matter
of selective reasoning

390
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,050
if you argue it as an
important part of the sport.

391
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,490
But, even if it is he
still does have to walk,

392
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,890
he still plays golf standing up,

393
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,570
it's not as if he's playing golf
from a wheelchair.

394
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,450
Alright.

395
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,650
Who else?

396
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:48,740
Go ahead.

397
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,860
I think the whole point
of a competition

398
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,180
is that it calls out the best, you know,
from the second best or from the third best.

399
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,190
And when we're talking
about the national level,

400
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,100
we're talking about the
highest of the highest.

401
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,930
I think what they're arguing about here
is the purpose of competition.

402
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,540
And I think in the sake of competition
you can't change the rules.

403
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,380
So, the purpose of the
competition includes walking?

404
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,540
That's an essential,
you agree with Tom.

405
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,820
And what's your name?

406
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,130
David.

407
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,140
The Supreme Court
ruled

408
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,030
that the PGA did have to
accommodate Casey Martin

409
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,420
and they did it on grounds
that Riva mentioned,

410
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,750
that walking isn't really part of,
an essential part of the game.

411
00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:33,460
They cited testimony saying
that walking the court

412
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,550
consumes no more calories
than you get eating a Big Mac.

413
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,780
That's what walking is in golf,

414
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,260
according to the majority.

415
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,340
Scalia was in dissent.

416
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,670
Justice Scalia agreed with David.

417
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,620
He said

418
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,670
there is no purpose,

419
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,810
and it's certainly not your course to try to
figure out the essential purpose of golf.

420
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:05,700
Golf is like any game,
it's strictly for amusement.

421
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,380
And if there's a group that wants
to have one version of the game

422
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,500
they can have that
version of the game.

423
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,700
And the market can decide
whether people are amused

424
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:18,890
and like and show up for that
and watch the television broadcasts.

425
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:25,260
Scalia's dissent was an
anti-Aristotelian dissent,

426
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,820
because notice two things
about the argument;

427
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,830
first we're thrust into a discussion
about what the essential nature,

428
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,020
or purpose,
or telos of golf really is.

429
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,780
Does it include walking?

430
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:44,570
And, here's something I think is rumbling
beneath the surface of this debate,

431
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:51,210
whether walking partly determines whether
golf is really an athletic competition.

432
00:25:52,929 --> 00:25:54,550
After all, the ball sits still.

433
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,000
You have to put it in a hole.

434
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,750
Is it more like basketball,
baseball, and football?

435
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,230
Golf, an athletic competition?

436
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,160
Or is it more like billiards?

437
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,980
The ball sits still
there too.

438
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,670
You can be out of shape
and succeed.

439
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,060
It involves skill

440
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,930
but not athletic skill.

441
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,540
Could it be that those
professional golfers,

442
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,810
who excel at golf,

443
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:25,620
have a stake in golf being honored
and recognized as an athletic event,

444
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,290
not just a game of skill like billiards?

445
00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:35,140
And if that's what's at stake,
then we have a debate about the purpose,

446
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,580
the teleological dimension,

447
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,500
and also a debate about honor.

448
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:42,180
What virtues,

449
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,020
really,

450
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:49,380
does the game of golf
honor and recognize?

451
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:53,350
Two questions to which
Aristotle directs our attention.

452
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,730
We'll continue
on this case next time.

453
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:06,490
What's strange
and seems paradoxical to me

454
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,450
about Aristotle's view point

455
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,180
is that if you walk like a pirate
and you talk like a pirate

456
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:14,020
you shouldn't be
an investment banker,

457
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:18,740
because that's not what
you're inherently supposed to do.

458
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:20,570
If you have a peg leg
and an eye patch

459
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,500
and a disgruntled disposition,
you know,

460
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:26,100
you should be on a pirate ship
on the high seas.

461
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:28,150
So he doesn't . . .

462
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,790
Some would say

463
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,890
that the distinction
between the two vocations

464
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,670
is not as clear as you suggest.

465
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,020
When we ended last time
we were talking about

466
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,460
whether Casey Martin
has a right to ride in a golf cart

467
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,790
in the PGA Tournament.

468
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,060
And it's worth remembering
how we got into this debate

469
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,020
and what's at stake for an
understanding of political philosophy.

470
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,690
Remember, we were looking
at Aristotle's theory of justice

471
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,580
and one way of describing
his approach to justice,

472
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,890
we've called it 'teleological'.

473
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,980
Teleological, because he says
to allocate rights

474
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:15,480
we first have to figure out
the purpose, or the end,

475
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,940
of the social practice in question.

476
00:28:19,629 --> 00:28:23,620
Another way of describing
Aristotle's account of Justice

477
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,080
is that justice is,
for him, a matter of fit;

478
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:33,880
it's a matter of fitting persons
with their virtues and excellences

479
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,620
to the appropriate roles.

480
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,320
Now, I want to finish our discussion

481
00:28:41,629 --> 00:28:44,980
about Casey Martin
and his claim for a golf cart,

482
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:51,020
and then go back to one more
consequential application in Aristotle,

483
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,860
namely, the question of slavery.

484
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:58,140
What do you think about
Casey Martin's request?

485
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,700
Should there be an
accommodation or not,

486
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:05,090
given the nature of the game
and of the tournament

487
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,820
and its purposes?

488
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,500
"Isn't it discrimination if he's not provided
the golf cart as an accommodation",

489
00:29:13,129 --> 00:29:14,340
say some.

490
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,720
Others reply, "No, if he got a cart
it would be unfair to the other golfers

491
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:20,400
because they exert themselves,

492
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,800
become winded, fatigued,
walking the course".

493
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:26,060
That's where we left it.

494
00:29:30,189 --> 00:29:32,780
What about the fairness argument?

495
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,140
OK, Jenny.

496
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,370
My question was

497
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,580
why doesn't the PGA
just make the option of a cart

498
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,620
available to all golfers?

499
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,740
From our readings I learned that
there are many golf tournaments,

500
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:51,140
other than the PGA,
where using a cart is not prohibited.

501
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,470
For instance, the Seniors Tournament
it's even allowed and encouraged.

502
00:29:56,939 --> 00:29:58,620
So why doesn't the PGA just do that?

503
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,860
Let everybody use
a cart?

504
00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:03,300
Give everyone
the option of using a cart

505
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,860
and let them pick.

506
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:06,890
So then the traditionalists
can then still say,

507
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,250
"Well, I still choose
to walk the course

508
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,280
but I do that knowing that I
will be more tired at the end

509
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:13,580
than the people
who took the cart."

510
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,540
Good.

511
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,940
Alright, so what about Jenny's solution?

512
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,660
For the sake of fairness,

513
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,250
don't give Casey Martin
an advantage,

514
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,170
if indeed there is an
advantage to riding in a cart.

515
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,210
Let everyone who wants to

516
00:30:31,939 --> 00:30:33,040
use a cart.

517
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:36,440
Is everyone happy
with that solution?

518
00:30:37,689 --> 00:30:39,970
Does it put to rest
this whole dilemma?

519
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,370
Who has an answer for Jenny?

520
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,050
Yes.

521
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,620
As was brought up last time,

522
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:53,240
if you do that you kind of
ruin some of the spirit of golf

523
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,880
as a lot of people like to see it.

524
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,580
If you let everybody take a cart.

525
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,340
Even though it gives everybody
the same playing field now,

526
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,620
it sort of makes golf less
of an athletic game,

527
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,020
like people pointed out last class.

528
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:09,980
It's just like if someone decides
to go into another sport

529
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,380
and they want an advantage.

530
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,690
Like, if you have swimming

531
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,620
and then you say,
"OK, he wants flippers

532
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,050
so why don't we just allow everyone
to have flippers when they're swimming?"

533
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:22,180
And what would that do to the
Olympic Swimming Competition,

534
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:23,850
if people were free to use,

535
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,340
Jenny, we better
let Jenny reply to this.

536
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,860
Da says it would sort of spoil
the spirit of the athletic competition

537
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:35,620
as if in Olympic swimming
you let anyone who wanted to

538
00:31:35,879 --> 00:31:37,460
swim with flippers.

539
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:40,860
Alright, Jenny,
what do you say to Da?

540
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,130
It would spoil the spirit of it.

541
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,020
You're also ruining
the spirit of golf

542
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,840
by not letting people who are
really passionate about the game,

543
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,980
and very good at it,

544
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:55,620
compete simply because
of an aspect of golf which is not,

545
00:31:56,199 --> 00:32:00,300
the main point of golf is you
use the club to make strokes

546
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,500
and hit it into a hole.

547
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,010
I'm sorry, I'm not a golfer

548
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,340
but that's basically the gist
of the game from what I see it.

549
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,300
And I was reading the
PGA versus Casey Martin decision

550
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,670
that was one of the
sentences that they said

551
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,300
is because walking the course
is not an inherent part of golf,

552
00:32:17,629 --> 00:32:19,150
only swinging the club is.

553
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,820
Good. So, Jenny replies
to Da,

554
00:32:25,629 --> 00:32:28,580
well, it isn't really essential
anyhow to walk the course.

555
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:30,500
So, we're back to the purpose.

556
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:33,310
I mean, I'm sure there are,
like wheelchair basketball,

557
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:37,120
there are certain
different competitions

558
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,220
that can be made for people
who may only be able to use their arms.

559
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:43,140
Right. Yes.

560
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:44,900
Michael what do you think?

561
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:48,040
Jenny just said that there is
stuff like wheelchair basketball

562
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,130
where if you can't play basketball
there is another option.

563
00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:52,650
I think there are other options
in the PGA Tour.

564
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,880
But the PGA Tour is the best,
is the pinnacle,

565
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,540
and you have to have certain
requirements fulfilled to perform.

566
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,090
Alright, Michael, you want
to say to Casey Martin

567
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,880
there is such a thing
as a Special Olympics

568
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,570
for those who are disabled.

569
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:12,860
Go play in the golfing version
of the Special Olympics.

570
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,840
That's what you would say Michael?
-- Yeah.

571
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,030
I think that walking is part
of the sport of golf.

572
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,590
And Casey Martin, you know
if he can't walk the course

573
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,340
then I don't think he should
be able to play in the PGA.

574
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,110
Alright, well thank you very much

575
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,430
for that exchange.

576
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,730
What comes out
of this exchange

577
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:30,980
that goes back to Aristotle's
theory of justice?

578
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,980
Well, one thing is the question,

579
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,540
is walking an essential part of golf?

580
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:44,300
And the very fact that deciding
whether there is a right

581
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,070
for Casey Martin
that the PGA must respect,

582
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,860
seems to depend,
as Aristotle suggests it must,

583
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,520
on debating and
resolving the question,

584
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:02,830
is walking essential
to the game of golf?

585
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,030
That's one moral of the story.

586
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,260
But there's a second moral
to the story

587
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,300
from an Aristotelian point of view.

588
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:15,620
What's at stake here,
this is the second Aristotelian

589
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,730
stake in this debate,

590
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,790
is honor.

591
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,660
Casey Martin wants the accommodation
so that he can compete

592
00:34:27,779 --> 00:34:28,910
for the honor

593
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,060
of winning the best tournaments.

594
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,780
Now, why is it

595
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,890
that the professional golfers,
the great golfers,

596
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,540
testified in this case -
Jack Nicklaus, Tom Kite -

597
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:44,860
in the readings,

598
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:47,100
against letting him use a cart

599
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,500
and they, I would suspect,
would be equally vehement, Jenny,

600
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:56,020
in opposing your suggestion
of letting everyone ride in a cart,

601
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:59,310
and this goes back, in a way,
to Da's point.

602
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,860
How to put this gently?

603
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,170
Professional golfers are sensitive

604
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,180
about whether their
sport is really a sport.

605
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:21,100
Because if everyone rode
around in a cart, or could,

606
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,400
then it would become clear,

607
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,330
or clearer, depending
on your point of view,

608
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,570
that golf is not really
an athletic competition

609
00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:32,700
but rather a game;

610
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,280
a game of skill
but not a sport.

611
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,300
And so not only the question
of debating the purpose,

612
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,130
the teleological feature,

613
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:51,310
but also from the standpoint of viewing
debates about the purpose of golf.

614
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,660
What's essential to golf?

615
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,500
Those debates,
Aristotle suggests,

616
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,660
inevitably are also debates
about the allocation of honor.

617
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,380
Because part of
the purpose of golf

618
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:07,510
is not just to
amuse spectators;

619
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,550
Scalia's wrong about that,

620
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,780
from Aristotle's point of view.

621
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,000
It's not just to
provide entertainment,

622
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,740
it's not just to make people happy.

623
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,190
It's not a mere amusement.

624
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,790
It's honoring,
it's rewarding,

625
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,420
it's recognizing a certain
kind of athletic excellence,

626
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,180
at least those who have
achieved the highest honors

627
00:36:30,549 --> 00:36:35,140
have a powerful stake
in maintaining that view.

628
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:40,220
Now, some of you took
the position the Scalia position.

629
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,820
"This is an incredibly difficult
and silly question", Scalia said.

630
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,460
"What is the essential nature of golf?"

631
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,800
It's not the kind of thing that
the United States Supreme Court

632
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,820
is equipped to decide,
or should decide.

633
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,600
That's Scalia.

634
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:00,410
But he only he says that

635
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:04,940
because he takes a very strong,
and as it happens,

636
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,570
anti-Aristotelian position

637
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,100
on what a game is.

638
00:37:11,509 --> 00:37:13,080
"It is the very nature of a game

639
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,580
to have no object,"
no point,

640
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,340
"except amusement"
says Scalia,

641
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:24,290
"That is what distinguishes games"
he says, "From productive activity."

642
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,700
You can just imagine what kind
of sports fan Scalia must be.

643
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,170
"And so", he says, "It's impossible to say
that any of the game's arbitrary rules

644
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,380
is essential."

645
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:42,370
And then he quotes Mark Twain's
disparaging remark

646
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,860
about golf.

647
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,380
He says, "Many consider walking
to be the central feature of golf.

648
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:50,800
Hence, Mark Twain's
classic criticism of the sport

649
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,470
'a good walk spoiled'."

650
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,070
But Scalia misses

651
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,850
an important feature of games

652
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,340
and the arguments
about rights and fairness

653
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,300
that arise from games,

654
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:18,130
when he casts games,
sports, athletic competitions,

655
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:21,020
as solely for the
sake of amusement;

656
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:26,740
as solely an utilitarian activity.

657
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,940
But an Aristotelian
view of sports says,

658
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,630
no it's not just about amusement,

659
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,620
real sports,
real athletic events,

660
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:38,560
are also about appreciation,
not just amusement.

661
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,680
And people who follow sports
and care about sports

662
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:44,780
and play sports
know this.

663
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:47,680
Which is another way of saying,

664
00:38:48,279 --> 00:38:51,740
there's a difference between
a sport and a mere spectacle.

665
00:38:52,319 --> 00:38:55,610
And the difference is
that a sport is a practice

666
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,920
that calls forth
and honors and prizes

667
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,420
certain excellences,
certain virtues.

668
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,130
And the people who
appreciate those virtues

669
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:11,980
are the true fans,
the informed fans,

670
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,220
and for them watching the sport
is not mere amusement.

671
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,850
But that means that it's always
possible to make sense

672
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,500
of the debate about

673
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,140
what feature of a sport
is essential to it.

674
00:39:27,279 --> 00:39:28,920
We can make sense
of these arguments.

675
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,100
Never mind the question whether
the court should decide.

676
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,180
The PGA in its own
internal deliberations

677
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,280
can make sense
of that debate,

678
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,600
which is why they
cared very much

679
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,740
about their view,
insisting on their view,

680
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,020
that walking,
an exertion, and fatigue

681
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,940
are essential, not peripheral,
parts of sport.

682
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:55,540
Well, this is all to illustrate

683
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:01,460
the teleological and
the honorific feature

684
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,380
of debates about rights,

685
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,420
which Aristotle says
we need to take account of

686
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,360
in thinking about justice.

687
00:40:11,549 --> 00:40:15,260
Now, I want to begin
for us to consider

688
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,110
whether Aristotle's theory of justice

689
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,270
is right or wrong;

690
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,190
whether it's persuasive
or unpersuasive.

691
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:24,580
I want to get your
thoughts about that.

692
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:32,260
But I want to anticipate one obvious
and important objection.

693
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,740
If justice is about fit,
fitting persons to roles,

694
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:42,860
matching virtues

695
00:40:43,549 --> 00:40:45,740
to the appropriate honors
and recognition.

696
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,860
If that's what justice is,

697
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,890
does it leave room for freedom?

698
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,820
And this is one of the
main objections

699
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:58,260
to Aristotle's teleological
account of justice.

700
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,140
If certain roles,
social roles,

701
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,780
are fitting,
or appropriate, to me

702
00:41:06,509 --> 00:41:08,420
where does that leave my right

703
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,420
to choose my social roles,

704
00:41:13,299 --> 00:41:16,180
my life purposes,
for myself?

705
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,220
What room does teleology
leave for freedom?

706
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,540
And in fact,
you may remember,

707
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,580
Rawls rejects teleological
accounts of justice

708
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,060
because he says that

709
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,600
teleological theories of justice

710
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,370
threaten

711
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,920
the equal basic rights of citizens.

712
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,140
So, let's begin to examine

713
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,150
whether Aristotle is right,
and in particular,

714
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,270
whether his teleological way
of thinking about justice

715
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,260
is at odds with freedom.

716
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:08,910
Now, one obvious reason to worry

717
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,860
is Aristotle's defense of slavery.

718
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:18,110
He defends slavery,

719
00:42:19,759 --> 00:42:23,680
which existed as an institution
in the Athens of his day.

720
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:27,030
Well, what is his defense of slavery?

721
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:35,040
Two things, two conditions,
have to be met

722
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,210
for slavery to be just.

723
00:42:38,799 --> 00:42:41,420
First, it has to be necessary.

724
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:45,020
and Aristotle says,
at least in our society,

725
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,020
slavery is necessary.

726
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,340
Why is it necessary?

727
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,340
If there are to be citizens

728
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:59,130
who are freed from manual
and menial and household chores

729
00:43:00,109 --> 00:43:03,260
to go to the assembly,
to deliberate about politics,

730
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,540
there have to be some who
look after those menial tasks;

731
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:11,660
the mere necessities of life.

732
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,020
He says, unless you could invent
in some science-fiction

733
00:43:19,339 --> 00:43:20,740
a technological fix

734
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:25,690
then there are going to be
those who have to do

735
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:28,980
the hard and difficult
and menial labor

736
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,580
if there are going to be citizens
deliberating about the good

737
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,870
and realizing their nature.

738
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,620
So slavery is necessary

739
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:38,940
for the life of the polis

740
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,390
for there to be open to citizens.

741
00:43:44,779 --> 00:43:46,350
The life of deliberation,
of argument,

742
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,700
of practical wisdom.

743
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,940
But there's a further condition
that has to be met.

744
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:55,700
Slavery has not only to be necessary
for the community as a whole to function,

745
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:03,420
but it also has to be the case,
remember the criterion of fit?

746
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,290
It also has to be the case
that there are some people

747
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,580
for whom being a slave
is the just, or the fitting,

748
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,300
or the appropriate condition.

749
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:17,580
Now, Aristotle agrees
that by his own standards,

750
00:44:17,759 --> 00:44:20,140
both of those conditions
must be met, must be true,

751
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,900
if slavery is to be just.

752
00:44:23,759 --> 00:44:26,400
And then,
in a deplorable passage,

753
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:29,090
he says, well, it is true

754
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,260
that there are some people
who are fit by nature

755
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,450
who are cut out to be slaves.

756
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,620
These are people who differ
from ordinary people

757
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:41,950
in the same way that the
body differs from the soul.

758
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,580
These are people who
are meant to be ruled,

759
00:44:43,799 --> 00:44:45,020
and for them

760
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,860
their nature is best realized
if they're slaves.

761
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,460
They can recognize reason in others

762
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:57,650
but they can't partake of it,
they can't exercise it.

763
00:44:58,759 --> 00:44:59,820
And somehow we can know this.

764
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:06,020
Now, Aristotle must have known
that there was something dodgy,

765
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:09,780
something strained
about this claim,

766
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:17,260
because he quickly acknowledges
that those who disagree may have a point.

767
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,340
And what those who
disagree point out is

768
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:24,130
that there are a lot
of people in Athens

769
00:45:24,279 --> 00:45:25,510
who are slaves

770
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,390
not because they
were born to be slaves,

771
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:31,100
or fit to be slaves,

772
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,180
but because they were captured,
they were losers in a war.

773
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:39,860
And so, Aristotle admits that
as practiced in ancient Athens,

774
00:45:41,549 --> 00:45:45,940
slavery didn't necessarily line up
with who actually is fit

775
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,560
or born to be a slave,

776
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,080
because some actual slaves
just were slaves by bad luck,

777
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,020
by being captured in a war.

778
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:56,180
And on Aristotle's own account

779
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,340
even if it's necessary to have slavery
for the sake of citizenship

780
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,420
it's unjust if people
who aren't properly slaves

781
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,140
are cast in that role.

782
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,900
There is a misfit.

783
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:12,820
Aristotle recognizes that slavery
for those who aren't fit for the task

784
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,420
is a kind of coercion.

785
00:46:14,799 --> 00:46:18,390
The reason slavery is wrong
is not because it's coerced.

786
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:20,780
Coercion is an indicator
that it's wrong,

787
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:22,780
because it's not natural.

788
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,130
If you have to coerce
someone into a role

789
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,860
that's a pretty good indication
that they don't belong there,

790
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,780
that that role isn't fitting for them.

791
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:33,740
And Aristotle recognized this.

792
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:38,100
So, all of this is to say
the example of slavery,

793
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,470
Aristotle's defense of it,

794
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,810
doesn't show that there isn't
anything wrong in principle

795
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,630
with teleological argument,
with the idea of justice as fit

796
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,480
between persons and roles,

797
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,880
because it's perfectly possible
within Aristotle's own terms,

798
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,940
to explain what's wrong
with this application,

799
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,540
this practical application

800
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:01,730
that he made of his theory.

801
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,580
I want to turn to the larger challenge
to Aristotle in the name of freedom.

802
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,350
But before I do that

803
00:47:10,259 --> 00:47:12,070
I want to see what people think

804
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,620
of Aristotle's account
of justice as fit,

805
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:20,110
his teleological way of
reasoning about justice

806
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,060
and the honorific
dimension of rights

807
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,740
and of distributive justice

808
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:31,230
that immerged in our discussion
of flutes and politics and golf.

809
00:47:31,879 --> 00:47:34,580
Questions of clarification
about Aristotle

810
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:40,700
or objections to his overall account.

811
00:47:42,129 --> 00:47:43,380
Yes.

812
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:45,900
My objection to Aristotle

813
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,960
is that he wants to match
a person to a role.

814
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,660
And, you know, if you walk like
a pirate and you talk like a pirate,

815
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:55,410
you know, you should be a pirate.
And that is what is right.

816
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:01,180
And so what's strange
and seems paradoxical to me

817
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,160
about Aristotle's view point

818
00:48:03,279 --> 00:48:06,860
is that if you walk like a pirate
and you talk like a pirate

819
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,740
you shouldn't be
an investment banker,

820
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,330
because that's not what you're
inherently supposed to do.

821
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,290
If you have a peg leg
and an eye patch

822
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,220
and a disgruntled disposition,
you know,

823
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,820
you should be on a pirate ship
on the high seas.

824
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,740
So he doesn't...


825
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,700
Some would say

826
00:48:26,299 --> 00:48:28,600
that the distinction
between the two vocations

827
00:48:28,759 --> 00:48:30,180
is not as clear as you suggest.

828
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:35,020
Alright, but that's
good.

829
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:36,110
I take your point.

830
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,940
Yes, go ahead.

831
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:40,260
It just seems to ignore
individual rights.

832
00:48:40,799 --> 00:48:44,880
So, I might be the perfect
janitor in the whole world

833
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,220
and I can do that job
the most efficiently

834
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,380
out of anybody
that exists right now,

835
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,860
but I might not
want to do that.

836
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,500
I might want to do any
other number of pursuits

837
00:48:54,859 --> 00:48:57,940
and it seems to say that
that isn't really a good option for me.

838
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,560
Alright,
and what's your name?

839
00:49:00,879 --> 00:49:02,230
-- Mary-Kate.
-- Good.

840
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,580
Alright, let's take a couple more.

841
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,400
Yes.

842
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,900
I think that the
golf cart exchange

843
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:13,390
sort of brought up what
I see as my main objection

844
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,900
to this teleological
mode of reasoning.

845
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,310
I mean, Michael,
I think that's your name, right?

846
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,580
Believes that walking is
an inherent part of golf.

847
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:29,260
Myself, I believe that walking
is not an inherent part of golf.

848
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,620
And I feel that
no matter how long

849
00:49:33,259 --> 00:49:36,240
we debate this particular
point of contention

850
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,280
we're never going
to reach an accord.

851
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:42,140
The teleological framework of reasoning,
I believe,

852
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:46,450
doesn't really allow us to come
to any sort of agreement.

853
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,440
Alright,
and what's your name?

854
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,940
-- Patrick.
-- Patrick.

855
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:55,050
Alright, let me try to address
this set of objections to Aristotle.

856
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,580
Let me start with Patrick's;

857
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:01,370
it's an important objection.

858
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:06,220
We had a debate about whether
walking is essential to golf,

859
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,780
and even in so seemingly trivial,
or at least contained, a case as that,

860
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,370
we couldn't agree.

861
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,930
How can we possibly
hope to agree?

862
00:50:16,589 --> 00:50:17,900
When the stakes are higher

863
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,700
and when we're debating the
fundamental purposes, or ends,

864
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,320
of political community.

865
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,500
And so, if we can't agree

866
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,720
in what the ends or the goods

867
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:32,380
of our shared public life consist in,

868
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:35,900
how can we base
justice and rights

869
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:38,940
on some notion
of what the end,

870
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:41,920
or the purpose,
or the good consists in?

871
00:50:43,399 --> 00:50:44,580
That's an important objection.

872
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:51,000
So much so that much modern
political theory takes that worry

873
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,860
about disagreement over the good
as its starting point,

874
00:50:54,399 --> 00:51:04,900
and concludes that justice
and rights and constitutions

875
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,140
should not be based on any
particular conception of the good

876
00:51:08,359 --> 00:51:10,940
or the purposes of political life,

877
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,980
but should, instead,
provide a framework of rights

878
00:51:15,259 --> 00:51:18,900
that leaves people free to choose
their conceptions of the good,

879
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:21,860
their own conceptions
of the purposes of life.

880
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:28,940
Now, Mary-Kate said, "What if a person is
very well suited to having a certain role,

881
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,660
like the role of being a janitor,

882
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:33,770
but wants something else,
wants to reach higher,

883
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,540
wants to choose another way of life?"

884
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:39,430
So, that goes back to
this question about freedom.

885
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:42,700
If we take our bearing as persons

886
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,770
from roles that are
said to fit our nature,

887
00:51:48,649 --> 00:51:51,790
shouldn't it at least be up to us
to decide what those roles are?

888
00:51:53,799 --> 00:51:58,430
In fact, shouldn't it be up to us to
define what roles are suitable to us?

889
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,620
And that's going to take us back

890
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,490
to the confrontation between
Aristotle on the one hand

891
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,140
and Kant and Rawls on the other.

892
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:10,020
Kant and Rawls think
Patrick has a point.

893
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:14,310
They say precisely
because people disagree

894
00:52:14,879 --> 00:52:16,140
in pluralist societies

895
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:19,220
about the nature
of the good life,

896
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:24,180
we shouldn't try to base justice on
any particular answer to that question.

897
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:27,060
So they reject teleology,

898
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:31,860
they reject the idea of tying justice
to some conception of the good.

899
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:35,090
What's at stake in the
debate about teleology,

900
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,240
say Rawlsian and Kantian liberals,

901
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,780
is this;

902
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:43,780
if you tie justice to a particular
conception of the good,

903
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:48,620
if you see justice as a matter of fit
between a person and his or her roles,

904
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,240
you don't leave room for freedom,

905
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:55,980
and to be free is to
be independent of

906
00:52:56,359 --> 00:53:00,100
any particular roles,
or traditions,

907
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:04,700
or conventions that may be
handed down by my parents

908
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,200
or my society.

909
00:53:07,799 --> 00:53:11,780
So, in order to decide as between
these two broad traditions,

910
00:53:12,279 --> 00:53:15,460
whether Aristotle is right,
or whether Kant and Rawls are right,

911
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:20,080
we need to investigate whether
the right is prior to the good,

912
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:21,380
question one,

913
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:26,100
and we need to investigate what
it means to be a free person,

914
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,920
a free moral agent.

915
00:53:28,799 --> 00:53:32,700
Does freedom require that
I stand for toward my roles,

916
00:53:32,879 --> 00:53:36,120
my ends, and my purposes
as an agent of choice?

917
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:42,110
Or as someone trying to discover
what my nature really is?

918
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,620
Two big questions
and we'll take them up next time.
