00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,190
When we ended last time,
we were discussing

2
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,470
Locke's idea of government
by consent and the question arose,

3
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:46,660
"What are the limits on government
that even the agreement

4
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,620
of the majority can't override?"

5
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,970
That was the question we ended with.

6
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,960
We saw in the case of property rights

7
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,140
that on Locke's view
a democratically elected government

8
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,870
has the right to tax people.

9
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,190
It has to be taxation
with consent

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,460
because it does involve the taking
of people's property

11
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:23,030
for the common good
but it doesn't require the consent

12
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:29,240
of each individual
at the time the tax is enacted or collected.

13
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,050
What it does require
is a prior act of consent

14
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,110
to join the society,
to take on the political obligation

15
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:48,860
but once you take on that obligation,
you agree to be bound by the majority.

16
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,000
So much for taxation.
But what you may ask,

17
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:01,680
about the right to life?
Can the government conscript people

18
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,910
and send them into battle?

19
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,720
And what about the idea
that we own ourselves?

20
00:02:07,839 --> 00:02:12,810
Isn't the idea of self-possession
violated if the government can,

21
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,520
through coercive legislation
and enforcement powers, say

22
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,590
"You must go risk your life to fight in Iraq."

23
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,010
What would Locke say?

24
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,870
Does the government
have the right to do that?

25
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:34,230
Yes. In fact he says in 139,
he says,

26
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:42,800
"What matters is that the
political authority or the military authority

27
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,200
not be arbitrary, that's what matters."

28
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,810
And he gives a wonderful example.

29
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,880
He says "A sergeant, even a sergeant,
let alone a general,

30
00:02:54,390 --> 00:03:00,220
a sergeant can command a soldier
to go right up to a face of a cannon

31
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:09,340
where he is almost sure to die,
that the sergeant can do.

32
00:03:13,649 --> 00:03:17,290
The general can condemn the soldier
to death for deserting his post

33
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,520
or for not obeying even a desperate order.

34
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,570
But with all their power over life and death,
what these officers can't do

35
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:37,790
is take a penny of that soldier's money
because that has nothing to do

36
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:39,560
with the rightful authority,

37
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,360
that would be arbitrary
and it would be corrupt."

38
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,250
So consent winds up being
very powerful in Locke,

39
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,660
not consent of the individual
to the particular tax or military order,

40
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,770
but consent to join the government
and to be bound

41
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,520
by the majority in the first place.

42
00:03:57,399 --> 00:04:02,840
That's the consent that matters
and it matters so powerfully

43
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:07,640
that even the limited government
created by the fact

44
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:11,410
that we have an unalienable right
to life, liberty, and property,

45
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:15,330
even that limited government
is only limited in the sense

46
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:18,510
that it has to govern by
generally applicable laws,

47
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,200
the rule of law, it can't be arbitrary.
That's Locke.

48
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,600
Well this raises a question about consent.

49
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,590
Why is consent such a
powerful moral instrument

50
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:37,190
in creating political authority
and the obligation to obey?

51
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,830
Today we begin to investigate
the question of consent

52
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:52,290
by looking at a concrete case,
the case of military conscription.

53
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,940
Now some people say
if we have a fundamental right

54
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,370
that arises from the idea
that we own ourselves,

55
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,920
it's a violation of that right
for government to conscript citizens

56
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:16,010
to go fight in wars.
Others disagree.

57
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,200
Others say that's a
legitimate power of government,

58
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,750
of democratically elected governments,
anyhow,

59
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,780
and that we have an obligation to obey.

60
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:34,290
Let's take the case
of the United States fighting a war in Iraq.

61
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,940
News accounts tells us
that the military is having great difficulty

62
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,300
meeting its recruitment targets.

63
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:52,030
Consider three policies
that the U.S. government

64
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:54,900
might undertake to deal
with the fact

65
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,120
that it's not achieving
its recruiting targets.

66
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:04,750
Solution number one:
increase the pay and benefits

67
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,760
to attract a sufficient number of soldiers.

68
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:16,150
Option number two:
shift to a system of military conscription,

69
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,720
have a lottery,
and whose ever numbers are drawn,

70
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,590
go to fight in Iraq.

71
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:37,540
System number three:
outsource, hire what traditionally

72
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,000
have been called mercenaries,
people around the world

73
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,920
who are qualified,
able to do the work,

74
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,150
able to fight well,
and who are willing to do it

75
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,050
for the existing wage.

76
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,830
So let's take a quick poll here.

77
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,680
How many favor increasing the pay?

78
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,540
A huge majority.

79
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,860
How many favor going to conscription?

80
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,220
Maybe a dozen people
in the room favor conscription.

81
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,270
What about the outsourcing solution?

82
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:25,130
Okay, so there may be two,
three dozen.

83
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:37,430
During the Civil War,
the Union used a combination

84
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:45,010
of conscription and the market system
to fill the ranks of the military

85
00:07:45,109 --> 00:07:46,320
to fight in the Civil War.

86
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:51,150
It was a system
that began with conscription

87
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,710
but if you were drafted
and didn't want to serve,

88
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,870
you could hire a substitute
to take your place

89
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,200
and many people did.

90
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:12,100
You could pay whatever
the market required

91
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:17,110
in order to find a substitute,
people ran ads in newspapers,

92
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:24,030
in the classified ads offering
500 dollars, sometimes 1000 dollars,

93
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,760
for a substitute who would
go fight the Civil War

94
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,680
in their place.

95
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,220
In fact, it's reported
that Andrew Carnegie

96
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,270
was drafted and hired a substitute
to take his place

97
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,350
for an amount
that was a little less

98
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,830
than the amount he spent
in the year on fancy cigars.

99
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,640
Now I want to get your views
about this Civil War system,

100
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,870
call it the hybrid system,
conscription but with a buyout provision.

101
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,100
How many think it was a just system?

102
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,190
How many would defend
the Civil War system?

103
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,010
Anybody?
Anybody else?

104
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,610
How many think it was unjust?

105
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,650
Most of you
don't like the Civil War system,

106
00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:24,330
you think it's unjust.

107
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,640
Let's hear an objection.
Why don't you like it?

108
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:34,850
What's wrong with it? Yes.

109
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:42,140
Well by paying $300
to be exempt one time around,

110
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,060
you're really putting a price
on valuing human life

111
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:49,400
and we established earlier,
that's really hard to do

112
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:52,330
so they're trying to accomplish
something that really isn't feasible.

113
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:59,330
Good. So paying someone
$300 or $500 or $1,000 ¨C

114
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,260
You're basically saying
that's what their life is worth to you.

115
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,470
That's what their life is worth,
it's putting a dollar value on life.

116
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,670
That's good. What's your name?
-Liz.

117
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,050
Liz.

118
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,890
Well, who has an answer for Liz.

119
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,100
You defended the Civil War system,
what do you say?

120
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,390
If you don't like the price
then you have the freedom

121
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:24,930
to not be sold or hired
so it's completely up to you.

122
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:29,010
I don't think it's necessarily
putting a specific price

123
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,500
on you and if it's done by himself,
I don't think there's anything

124
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,990
that's really morally wrong with that.

125
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:39,170
So the person who takes the $500,

126
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:45,520
let's say, he's putting his own price
on his life

127
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:50,770
or on the risk of his life
and he should have the freedom

128
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:51,890
to choose to do that.

129
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,170
Exactly.

130
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,730
What's your name?
- Jason.

131
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,660
Jason. Thank you.
Now we need to hear

132
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,350
from another critic
of the civil war system. Yes.

133
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,160
It's a kind or coercion almost,
people who have lower incomes,

134
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:11,820
for Carnegie he can totally ignore the draft,
$300 is an irrelevant

135
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,230
in terms of his income
but someone of a lower income,

136
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,560
they're essentially being coerced to draft,
to be drafted,

137
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:22,610
it's probably they're not able
to find a replacement.

138
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:24,230
Tell me your name.

139
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:25,360
Sam.

140
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:30,970
Sam. All right so you say,
Sam, that when a poor laborer

141
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:39,070
accepts $300 to fight in the Civil War,
he is in effect being coerced

142
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,260
by that money
given his economic circumstances

143
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:49,410
whereas Carnegie can go off,
pay the money, and not serve.

144
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:55,810
Alright. I want to hear someone
who has a reply to Sam's argument,

145
00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:02,370
that what looks like a free exchange
is actually coercive.

146
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,360
Who has an answer to Sam?
Go ahead.

147
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,440
I'd actually agree with him in saying that ¨C

148
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:12,640
You agree with Sam.

149
00:12:12,969 --> 00:12:20,030
I agree with him in saying that it is coercion in the sense that it robs individual of his ability to reason.

150
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,020
Okay, and what's your name?

151
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,450
Raul.

152
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,080
All right. So Raul and Sam
agree that what looks

153
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,770
like a free exchange,
free choice, voluntary act

154
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,760
actually involves coercion.

155
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:37,610
It's profound coercion
of the worst kind

156
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,540
because it falls so disproportionately
upon one segment of the society.

157
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:44,710
Good. Alright. So Raul and Sam
have made a powerful point.

158
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:46,800
Who would like to reply?

159
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,060
Who has an answer for Sam and Raul?
Go ahead.

160
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:55,780
I don't think that these
drafting systems

161
00:12:56,099 --> 00:12:59,130
are really terribly different
from all volunteer army

162
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,880
sort of recruiting strategies.

163
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:05,610
The whole idea of having benefits
and pay for joining the army

164
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:10,450
is sort of a coercive strategy
to get people to join.

165
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,440
It is true that military volunteers
come from disproportionately

166
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:20,170
lower economic status
and also from certain regions of the country

167
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,880
where you can use like patriotism
to try and coerce people

168
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,380
to feel like it's the right thing to do
to volunteer and go over to Iraq.

169
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,050
And tell me your name.

170
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:29,070
Emily.

171
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:34,030
Alright, Emily says, and Raul
you're going to have to

172
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:35,340
reply to this so get ready.

173
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:42,670
Emily says fair enough,
there is a coercive element

174
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,220
to the Civil War system
when a laborer takes the place

175
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:52,950
of Andrew Carnegie for $500.
Emily concedes that but she says

176
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,730
if that troubles you about
the Civil War system

177
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:04,070
shouldn't that also trouble
you about the volunteer army today?

178
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,240
Before you answer,
how did you vote in the first poll?

179
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:11,830
Did you defend the volunteer army?
I didn't vote.

180
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:16,300
You didn't vote.
By the way,

181
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,090
you didn't vote
but did you sell your vote

182
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,210
to the person sitting next to you?
No. Alright.

183
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:25,630
So what would you say to that argument.

184
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,070
I think that the circumstances
are different in that

185
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:35,190
there was conscription in the Civil War.

186
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,700
There is no draft today
and I think that volunteers

187
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,180
for the army today have a
more profound sense of patriotism

188
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:48,190
that is of an individual choice
than those who were forced

189
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,340
into the military in the Civil War.

190
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,290
Somehow less coerced?

191
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,370
Less coerced.

192
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,770
Even though there is still inequality
in American Society?

193
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,730
Even though, as Emily points out,
the makeup of the American military

194
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:05,020
is not reflective of the population
as a whole?

195
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:10,710
Let's just do an experiment here.
How many here have either served

196
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:15,130
in the military or have a family member
who has served in the military

197
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,500
in this generation, not parents?

198
00:15:18,729 --> 00:15:20,300
Family members. In this generation.

199
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,410
And how many have neither served
nor have any brothers or sisters who have served?

200
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:32,660
Does that bear out your point Emily?

201
00:15:36,229 --> 00:15:36,830
Yes.

202
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:42,220
Alright. Now we need to hear from ¨C
most of you defended the idea

203
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:51,910
of the all volunteer military
overwhelmingly and yet overwhelmingly,

204
00:15:52,349 --> 00:15:55,720
people considered the
Civil War system unjust.

205
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:03,950
Sam and Raul articulated reasons
for objecting to the Civil War system,

206
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,340
it took place against a background
of inequality

207
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:12,020
and therefore the choices people made
to buy their way in to military service

208
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,910
were not truly free
but at least partly coerced.

209
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:21,870
Then Emily extends that argument
in the form of a challenge.

210
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:25,730
Alright, everyone here
who voted in favor

211
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:32,680
of the all volunteer army should be able ¨C
should have to explain

212
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,960
what's the difference in principle.

213
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:41,690
Doesn't the all volunteer army
simply universalize the feature

214
00:16:41,979 --> 00:16:46,660
that almost everyone found objectionable
in the Civil War buyout provision?

215
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,220
Did I state the challenge fairly Emily?

216
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,640
Yes.

217
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:53,630
Okay. So we need to hear
from a defender

218
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:58,540
of the all volunteer military
who can address Emily's challenge.

219
00:16:59,349 --> 00:17:02,360
Who can do that?
Go ahead.

220
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,480
The difference between the Civil War system
and the all volunteer army system

221
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:10,170
is that in the Civil War,
you're being hired not by the government,

222
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:14,430
but by an individual and as a result,
different people who get hired

223
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,570
by different individuals
get paid different amounts.

224
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,860
In the case of the all volunteer army,
everyone who gets hired

225
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:22,370
is hired by the government
and gets paid the same amount.

226
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,030
It's precisely the universalization of
essentially paying your way

227
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,620
to the army that makes
the all volunteer army just.

228
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,310
Emily?

229
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,740
I guess I'd frame the principle
slightly differently.

230
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,850
On the all volunteer army,
it's possible for somebody

231
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,040
to just step aside
and not really think

232
00:17:45,379 --> 00:17:47,450
about the war at all.
It's possible to say,

233
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,420
"I don't need the money,
I don't need to have an opinion about this,

234
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:55,630
I don't need to feel obligated
to take my part and defend my country.

235
00:17:57,129 --> 00:17:59,170
With the coercive system, or sorry,
with an explicit draft

236
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,170
then there's the threat
at least that every individual

237
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,000
will have to make
some sort of decision

238
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,450
regarding military conscription
and perhaps in that way,

239
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,280
it's more equitable.

240
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:14,400
It's true that Andrew Carnegie
might not serve in any case but in one,

241
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:18,590
he can completely step aside from it,
and the other there's some level of responsibility.

242
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,600
While you're there, Emily,
so what system do you favor, conscription?

243
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,010
I would be hard pressed to say
but I think so

244
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,650
because it makes the whole country
feel a sense of responsibility

245
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,270
for the conflict instead
of having a war

246
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,990
that's maybe ideologically supported
by a few but only if there's no real responsibility.

247
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,400
Good. Who wants to reply?
Go ahead.

248
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,480
So I was going to say
that the fundamental difference

249
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,750
between the all volunteer army
and then the army in the Civil War

250
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,110
is that in the all volunteer army,
if you want to volunteer

251
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,360
that comes first
and then the pay

252
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:59,490
comes after
whereas in the Civil War system,

253
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,390
the people who are accepting
the pay

254
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,180
aren't necessarily doing it
because they want to,

255
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:07,560
they're just doing it
for the money first.

256
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:13,520
What motivation beyond the pay
do you think is operating

257
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,670
in the case of the all volunteer army?

258
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,630
Like patriotism for the country.

259
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,210
Patriotism. Well what about ¨C

260
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,850
And a desire to defend the country.

261
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:29,450
There is some motivation in pay
but the fact that it's first and foremost

262
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,640
an all volunteer army will
motivate first I think, personally.

263
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,750
Do you think it's better?
And tell me your name.

264
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:36,450
Jackie.

265
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:39,200
Jackie do you think it's better
if people serve in the military

266
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,540
out of a sense of patriotism
than just for the money?

267
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:46,850
Yes, definitely because the people who ¨C
that was one of the main problems

268
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,580
in the Civil War
is that the people

269
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:51,320
that you're getting to go in it
to go to war

270
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,510
aren't necessarily people
who want to fight

271
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,780
and so they won't be as
good soldiers as they will be

272
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,770
had they been there because they wanted to be.

273
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:03,990
Alright, what about
Jackie's having raised the question of patriotism,

274
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,560
that patriotism is a better
or a higher motivation

275
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,970
than money for military service.

276
00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:17,180
Who would like to address that question?
Go ahead.

277
00:20:17,879 --> 00:20:21,230
Patriotism absolutely is not necessary
in order to be a good soldier

278
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,770
because mercenaries can do
just as good of a job

279
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:31,680
as anyone who waves the American flag
around and wants to defend

280
00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:34,080
what the government believes
that we should do.

281
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,650
Did you favor the outsourcing solution?

282
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:39,520
Yes sir.

283
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:46,210
Alright, so let Jackie respond.
What's your name?

284
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:47,380
Philip.

285
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,750
What about that Jackie?
So much for patriotism.

286
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,410
If you've got someone
whose heart is in it

287
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,120
more than another person,
they're going to do a better job.

288
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,960
When it comes down to the wire
and there's like a situation

289
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,540
in which someone has to put
their life on the line,

290
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,230
someone who's doing it
because they love this country

291
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,950
will be more willing
to go into danger

292
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,450
than someone who's just getting paid,
they don't care,

293
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,380
they've got the technical skills
but they don't care what happens

294
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,830
because they really have ¨C
they have nothing

295
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,420
like nothing invested in this country.

296
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,760
There's another aspect though
once we get on to the issue of patriotism.

297
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:29,540
If you believe patriotism,
as Jackie does,

298
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,530
should be the foremost consideration
and not money,

299
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:37,740
does that argue for or against
the paid army we have now?

300
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,470
We call it the volunteer army
though if you think about it,

301
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,390
that's a kind of misnomer.
A volunteer army as we use the term,

302
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,590
is a paid army.

303
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,660
So what about the suggestion
that patriotism should be

304
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,490
the primary motivation
for military service not money?

305
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,200
Does that argue in favor
of the paid military

306
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:06,580
that we have
or does it argue for conscription?

307
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:11,570
And just to sharpen that point
building on Phil's case for outsourcing,

308
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:19,120
if you think that the all volunteer army,
the paid army,

309
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:25,020
is best because it lets the market
allocate positions

310
00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:28,890
according to people's preferences
and willingness to serve

311
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:33,800
for a certain wage,
doesn't the logic that takes you

312
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:39,600
from a system of conscription
to the hybrid Civil War system

313
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:45,190
to the all volunteer army,
doesn't the idea of expanding

314
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:49,810
freedom of choice in the market,
doesn't that lead you

315
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:56,080
all the way if you followed that principle
consistently to a mercenary army?

316
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,990
And then if you say no,
Jackie says no,

317
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:10,080
patriotism should count for something,
doesn't that argue

318
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:13,900
for going back to conscription
if by patriotism,

319
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,820
you mean a sense of civic obligation?

320
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:23,460
Let's see if we can step back
from the discussion

321
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:27,160
that we've had and see
what we've learned

322
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:34,880
about consent as it applies
to market exchange.

323
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:47,390
We've really heard two arguments,
two arguments against the use of markets

324
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:54,210
and exchange in the allocation
of military service.

325
00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:01,390
One was the argument
raised by Sam and Raul,

326
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:11,470
the argument about coercion,
the objection that letting the market

327
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:15,700
allocate military service
may be unfair

328
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:21,420
and may not even be free
if there's severe inequality

329
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,640
in the society so that people
who buy their way into military service

330
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:37,330
are doing so not because they really want to
but because they have so few

331
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:42,400
economic opportunities
that that's their best choice

332
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,740
and Sam and Raul say
there's an element of coercion in that,

333
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,560
that's one argument.

334
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,990
Then there is a second objection
to using the market

335
00:24:55,379 --> 00:25:01,910
to allocate military service,
that's the idea that military service

336
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,160
shouldn't be treated
as just another job for pay

337
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,270
because it's bound up
with patriotism and civic obligation.

338
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,620
This is a different argument
from the argument about

339
00:25:13,949 --> 00:25:16,440
unfairness and inequality
and coercion,

340
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,190
it's an argument
that suggests that maybe

341
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:28,850
where civic obligations are concerned,
we shouldn't allocate

342
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,160
duties and rights by the market.

343
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,360
Now we've identified
two broad objections.

344
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:43,600
What do we need to know
to assess those objections?

345
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,820
To assess the first,
the argument from

346
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:54,340
coercion, inequality, and unfairness,
Sam, we need to ask

347
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,710
what inequalities in the background
conditions of society undermine

348
00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:04,610
the freedom of choices
people make to buy and sell their labor,

349
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,560
question number one.

350
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,260
Question number two:
to assess the civic obligation patriotism.

351
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,370
Argument: we have to ask
what are the obligations of citizenship?

352
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,600
Is military service one of them or not?

353
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,180
What obligates us as citizens?

354
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,500
What is the source of political obligation?

355
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:35,770
Is it consent
or are there some civic obligations

356
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:45,470
we have, even without consent,
for living and sharing in a certain kind of society?

357
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:49,090
We haven't answered
either of those questions

358
00:26:49,379 --> 00:26:52,310
but our debate today
about the Civil War system

359
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,230
and the all volunteer army
has at least raised them

360
00:26:55,879 --> 00:26:58,420
and those are questions
we're going to return to in the coming weeks.

361
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:37,890
Today I'd like to turn our attention
and get your views about an argument

362
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:43,800
over the role of markets in the
realm of human reproduction and procreation.

363
00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:54,160
Now with infertility clinics,
people advertise for egg donors

364
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,530
and from time to time,
in the Harvard Crimson

365
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,660
ads appear for egg donors.
Have you seen them?

366
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:07,860
There was one that ran
a few years ago

367
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:16,550
that wasn't looking for just any egg donor,
it was an ad that offered

368
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,820
a large financial incentive
for an egg donor

369
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:27,840
from a woman who was intelligent,
athletic, at least 5'10",

370
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:34,840
and with at least 1400
or above on her SATs.

371
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:42,800
How much do you think
the person looking for this egg donor

372
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,090
was willing to pay for an egg
from a woman of that description?

373
00:28:48,439 --> 00:28:50,690
What would you guess?
A thousand dollars?

374
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,790
Fifteen thousand? Ten?
I'll show you the ad.

375
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:15,040
Fifty thousand dollars for an egg
but only a premium egg.

376
00:29:17,129 --> 00:29:18,390
What do you think about that?

377
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:24,840
Well there are also sometimes
ads in the Harvard Crimson

378
00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:29,390
and the other college newspapers
for sperm donors.

379
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:42,990
So the market in reproductive
capacities is an equal opportunity market.

380
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:50,470
Well not exactly equal opportunity,
they're not offering $50,000 for sperm

381
00:29:52,889 --> 00:29:56,970
but there is a company,
a large commercial sperm bank

382
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:03,570
that markets sperm,
it's called California Cryobank,

383
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:12,350
it's a for-profit company,
it imposes exacting standards

384
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:21,490
on the sperm it recruits,
and it has offices in Cambridge,

385
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:26,170
between Harvard and MIT,
and in Palo Alto near Stanford.

386
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:37,330
Cryobank's marketing materials
play up the prestigious source of its sperm.

387
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:47,070
Here is, from the website of Cryobank,
the information.

388
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,410
Here they talk about
the compensation

389
00:30:55,949 --> 00:30:58,750
although compensation
should not be the only reason

390
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:03,420
for becoming a sperm donor,
we are aware of the considerable time

391
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,800
and expense involved in being a donor.

392
00:31:13,189 --> 00:31:20,660
So do you know what they offer?
Donors will be reimbursed $75 per specimen,

393
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,570
up to $900 a month if you donate
three times a week,

394
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,880
and then they add
"We periodically offer incentives

395
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:45,630
such as movie tickets or gift certificates
for the extra time and effort

396
00:31:46,129 --> 00:31:49,560
expended by participating donors."

397
00:31:51,139 --> 00:31:53,310
It's not easy to be a sperm donor.

398
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:58,460
They accept fewer than five
percent of the donors who apply.

399
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:03,370
Their admission criteria
are more demanding than Harvard's.

400
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:10,950
The head of the sperm bank
said the ideal sperm donor

401
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:16,330
is 6 feet tall, with a college degree,
brown eyes, blond hair,

402
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:23,910
and dimples for the simple reason
that these are the traits

403
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,120
that the market has shown
that customers want.

404
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:32,970
Quoting the head of the sperm bank,
"If our customers wanted high school dropouts,

405
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:34,930
we would give them high school dropouts."

406
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:44,750
So here are two instances,
the market in eggs for donation

407
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:49,820
and the market in sperm,
that raise a question,

408
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,780
a question about whether
eggs and sperm

409
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,880
should or should not be bought
and sold for money.

410
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,160
As you ponder that,
I want you to consider

411
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:13,170
another case involving market
and in fact a contract

412
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,910
in the human reproductive capacity
and this is the case

413
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,470
of commercial surrogate motherhood,
and it's a case that wound up

414
00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:29,270
in court some years ago.

415
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,880
It's the story of Baby M.

416
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:38,300
It began with William and Elizabeth Stern,
a professional couple wanting a baby

417
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,700
but they couldn't have one
on their own,

418
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:43,810
at least not without medical risk
to Mrs. Stern.

419
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:49,900
They went to an infertility clinic
where they met Mary Beth Whitehead,

420
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:54,420
a 29-year-old mother of two,
the wife of a sanitation worker.

421
00:33:55,409 --> 00:34:00,640
She had replied to an ad that The
Standard had placed seeking the service

422
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:06,490
of a surrogate mother.
They made a deal.

423
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,650
They signed a contract
in which William Stern

424
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:16,730
agreed to pay Mary Beth Whitehead
a $10,000 fee

425
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:24,670
plus all expenses in exchange
for which Mary Beth Whitehead

426
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:28,480
agreed to be artificially inseminated
with William Stern's sperm,

427
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:35,120
to bear the child,
and then to give the baby to the Sterns.

428
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:39,030
Well, you probably know
how the story unfolded.

429
00:34:40,049 --> 00:34:43,610
Mary Beth gave birth
and changed her mind,

430
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:46,190
she decided she wanted to keep the baby.

431
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:50,500
The case wound up in
court in New Jersey.

432
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:56,070
So let's take,
put aside any legal questions,

433
00:34:57,029 --> 00:35:00,090
and focus on this issue
as a moral question.

434
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:08,500
How many believe
that the right thing to do in the Baby M case,

435
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,280
would have been to uphold the contract,
to enforce the contract?

436
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,400
And how many think
the right thing to do

437
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,960
would have been not to
enforce that contract?

438
00:35:26,779 --> 00:35:32,190
The majority say enforce
so let's now hear the reasons

439
00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:34,700
that people had,
either for enforcing or refusing

440
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,110
to enforce this contract.

441
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:39,590
First I want to hear from someone
in the majority.

442
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,280
Why do you uphold the contract?
Why do you enforce it?

443
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:52,490
Who can offer a reason?
Yes. Stand up.

444
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,460
It's a binding contract,
all the parties involved

445
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:05,710
knew the terms of the contract
before any action was taken,

446
00:36:08,029 --> 00:36:11,090
it's a voluntary agreement,
the mother knew what she was getting into,

447
00:36:12,549 --> 00:36:16,810
all four intelligent adults,
regardless of formal education, whatever.

448
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,070
So it makes sense that if you know
that you're getting into beforehand

449
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,810
and you make a promise,
you should uphold that promise in the end.

450
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,560
Okay, a deal is a deal in other words.

451
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,410
Exactly.
- And what's your name?

452
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:29,770
Patrick.

453
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:33,370
Is Patrick's reason the reason
that most of you in the majority

454
00:36:34,779 --> 00:36:39,560
favored upholding the contract?
Yes. Alright, let's hear now someone

455
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,420
who would not enforce the contract.

456
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:51,210
What do you say to Patrick?
Why not? Yes.

457
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:54,240
Well, I mean, I agree,
I think contracts should be upheld

458
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:58,240
when all the parties know all the information
but in this case,

459
00:36:58,529 --> 00:37:02,740
I don't think there's a way a mother,
before the child exists,

460
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:06,370
could actually know
how she's going to feel about that child

461
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,550
so I don't think the mother actually
had all the information.

462
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,080
She didn't know the person
that was going to be born

463
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,820
and didn't know how much she would
love that person so that's my argument.

464
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,620
So you would not,
and what's your name?

465
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,000
Evan Wilson.

466
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:25,000
Evan says he would not uphold the
contract because when it was entered into

467
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:32,470
the surrogate mother couldn't be expected
to know in advance

468
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,560
how she would feel
so she didn't really have the relevant information

469
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,570
when she made that contract.

470
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:49,080
Who else?
Who else would not uphold the contract? Yes.

471
00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:55,400
I also think that a contract should
generally be upheld

472
00:37:55,870 --> 00:38:01,990
but I think that the child
has an inalienable right to its actual mother

473
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:06,820
and I think that if that mother
wants it then that child

474
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,060
should have the right to that mother.

475
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,010
You mean the biological mother not the adoptive mother?

476
00:38:12,529 --> 00:38:13,080
Right.

477
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:15,410
And why is that?
First of all, tell me your name.

478
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,540
Anna.

479
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:17,970
Anna. Why is that Anna?

480
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,800
Because I think that that bond
is created by nature

481
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,350
is stronger than any bond
that is created by a contract.

482
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,630
Good. Thank you.
Who else? Yes.

483
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:36,880
I disagree. I don't think that a child
has an inalienable right

484
00:38:37,299 --> 00:38:38,350
to her biological mother.

485
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,210
I think that adoption and surrogacy
are both legitimate tradeoffs

486
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:47,230
and I agree with the point made
that it's a voluntary agreement,

487
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,700
the individual who made it,
it's a voluntary agreement

488
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,920
and you can't apply
coercion to this argument.

489
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:58,650
You can't apply the objection
from coercion to this argument?

490
00:38:59,130 --> 00:38:59,760
Correct.

491
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:01,680
What's your name?
- Kathleen.

492
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:04,990
Kathleen, what do you say to
Evan that though there may not have been ¨C

493
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:08,570
Evan claimed that the consent
was tainted not by coercion

494
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:13,480
but by lack of adequate information.
She couldn't have known

495
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,370
the relevant information
namely how she would feel about the child.

496
00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:18,500
What do you say to that?

497
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,610
I don't think the emotional content
of her feelings plays into this.

498
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:25,360
I think in a case of law,
in the justice of this scenario,

499
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,470
her change of feelings are not relevant.

500
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:32,160
If I give up my child for adoption
and then I decide later on

501
00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:36,340
that I really want that child back,
too bad, it's a tradeoff,

502
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,740
it's a tradeoff that the mother has made.

503
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,820
So a deal is a deal,
you agree with Patrick?

504
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,760
I agree with Patrick,
a deal's a deal.

505
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,350
A deal is a deal.

506
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,340
Yes.
- Good. Yes.

507
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,070
I would say that though
I'm not really sure if I agree

508
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,910
with the idea that the child
has a right to their mother.

509
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,890
I think the mother definitely
has a right to her child

510
00:39:59,009 --> 00:40:01,180
and I also think that there's
some areas where market forces

511
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,190
shouldn't necessarily penetrate.

512
00:40:03,529 --> 00:40:06,800
I think that the whole
surrogate mother area

513
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:12,150
smacks a little bit of dealing
in human beings seems dehumanizing.

514
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:16,330
It doesn't really seem right
so that's my main reason.

515
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,500
And what is ¨C could you tell us your name.

516
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:19,730
I'm Andrew.

517
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:27,190
Andrew, what is dehumanizing about buying and
selling the right to a child, for money,

518
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,170
what is dehumanizing about it?

519
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:35,770
Well because you're buying
someone's biological right.

520
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:42,140
I mean you can't ¨C in the law as it stated,
you can't sell your own child

521
00:40:42,549 --> 00:40:45,380
were you to have a child,
I'd believe that the law

522
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:48,260
prohibits you selling it to another person or ¨C

523
00:40:48,509 --> 00:40:49,560
So this like baby selling?

524
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:52,250
Right. To a certain extent.

525
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,940
Though there's a contract
with another person,

526
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,120
you've made agreements and what not,
there is an undeniable emotional bond

527
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:01,860
that takes place between the mother
and the child and it's wrong

528
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,990
to simply ignore this because
you've written out something contractually.

529
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,730
Right. You want to reply to Andrew?
Stay there.

530
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,500
You point out there's an
undeniable emotional bond,

531
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:17,010
I feel like in this situation,
we're not necessarily arguing

532
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,030
against adoption or surrogacy in itself,
we're just sort of

533
00:41:21,319 --> 00:41:23,730
pointing out the emotional differences.

534
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,070
But wait, I mean,
it's easy to break everything down

535
00:41:27,509 --> 00:41:28,980
to numbers and say
"Oh, we have contracts,"

536
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:32,550
like you're buying or selling a car
but there are underlying emotions,

537
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,820
I mean, you're dealing with people,
these are not objects to be bought and sold.

538
00:41:36,779 --> 00:41:39,890
Alright. What about Andrew's claim
that this is like baby selling.

539
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,800
I believe that adoption and surrogacy
should be permitted,

540
00:41:42,029 --> 00:41:45,040
whether or not I actually will partake in it
is not really relevant

541
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:48,070
but I think that the government should,
the government should

542
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:52,910
give its citizens the rights
to allow for adoption and surrogacy.

543
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:55,910
But adoption is not ¨C according to ¨C

544
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,510
Is adoption baby selling?

545
00:41:59,279 --> 00:42:03,960
Well, do you think you should
be able to bid for a baby that's up for adoption?

546
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,300
That's Andrew's challenge.

547
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,910
Do I think I should be
able to bid for a baby?

548
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:18,530
I'm not - sure! It's a market,
I feel the extent to which it's been applied

549
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:22,480
and I'm not sure if the government
should be able to permit it

550
00:42:22,759 --> 00:42:25,090
and I have to think about it more but ¨C

551
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,130
Alright. Fair enough.
Are you satisfied Andrew?

552
00:42:27,569 --> 00:42:30,530
Well, yeah, I mean,
I think surrogacy should be permitted.

553
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:35,300
I think that people can do it
but I don't think that it should be

554
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,710
forced upon people that
once a contract is signed,

555
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:42,540
it's absolutely the end all.
I think that it's unenforceable.

556
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,370
So people should be free
Andrew to enter into these contracts

557
00:42:47,549 --> 00:42:49,120
but it should not be
enforceable in the court.

558
00:42:49,819 --> 00:42:50,560
Not in the court, no.

559
00:42:51,259 --> 00:42:55,500
Who would like to turn on
one side or the other? Yes.

560
00:42:56,509 --> 00:43:00,040
I think I have an interesting perspective
on this because my brother

561
00:43:00,509 --> 00:43:03,020
was actually one of the people
who donated to a sperm bank

562
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,710
and he was paid a very large amount of money,

563
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:09,650
he was six feet tall but not blond,
he had dimples though.

564
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,980
So he actually has, I'm an aunt now,
he has a daughter,

565
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:20,550
he donated his sperm to a lesbian couple
in Oklahoma and he has been

566
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:24,410
contacted by them and he has seen pictures
of his daughter but he still

567
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,790
does not feel an emotional bond
to his daughter,

568
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,000
he just has a sense of curiosity
about what she looks like

569
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,080
and what she's doing
and how she is.

570
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:39,040
He doesn't feel love for his child
so from this experience,

571
00:43:39,509 --> 00:43:45,030
I think the bond between a mother
and a child cannot be compared

572
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,120
to the bond between
the father and the child.

573
00:43:47,549 --> 00:43:49,120
That's really interesting.
What's your name?

574
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:50,200
Vivian.

575
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:54,030
Vivian. So we've got the case
of surrogacy, commercial surrogacy,

576
00:43:55,569 --> 00:43:59,210
and it's been compared to baby selling
and we've been exploring

577
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:05,920
whether that analogy
is apt and it can also be compared,

578
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:15,220
as you point out, to sperm selling.
But you're saying that sperm
selling and baby selling

579
00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:20,240
or even surrogacy are very different because ¨C

580
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:21,680
Yes, they're unequal services.

581
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,540
They're unequal services
and that's because Vivian,

582
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:27,580
you say that the tie, the bond ¨C

583
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:33,320
Yes, and also the time investment
that's given by a mother,

584
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:38,340
nine months, cannot be compared
to a man going into a sperm bank,

585
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,470
looking at pornography,
depositing into a cup.

586
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,350
I don't think those are equal.

587
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,050
Good. Alright.

588
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,930
Because that's what happens in a sperm bank.

589
00:44:55,310 --> 00:45:02,450
Alright. So this is really interesting,
we have ¨C notice the arguments

590
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,780
that have come out so far.

591
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:09,550
The objections to surrogacy,
the objections to enforcing

592
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,610
that contract are of at least two kinds.

593
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:17,140
There was the objection
about tainted consent,

594
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:21,250
this time not because of coercion
or implicit coercion

595
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:26,980
but because of imperfect
or flawed information.

596
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:34,950
So tainted or flawed consent
can arise either because of coercion

597
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:39,280
or because of a lack
of relevant information,

598
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:42,100
at least according
to one argument that we've heard

599
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,520
and then a second objection
to enforcing the surrogacy contract

600
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:50,460
was that it was somehow dehumanizing.

601
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,570
Now when this case
was decided by the courts,

602
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:57,910
what did they say about these arguments?

603
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,920
The lower court ruled
that the contract was enforceable,

604
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:06,400
neither party had a
superior bargaining position.

605
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:10,890
A price for the service
was struck and a bargain was reached.

606
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:16,430
One side didn't force the other
neither had disproportionate bargaining power.

607
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,850
Then it went to the New Jersey Supreme Court.

608
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:25,990
And what did they do?
They said this contract is not enforceable.

609
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:34,530
They did grant custody to Mr. Stern
as the father

610
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,170
because they thought that would be
in the best interest of the child

611
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:41,870
but they restored the rights of Mary Beth Whitehead

612
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:47,960
and left it to lower courts to decide
exactly what the visitation rights should be.

613
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:54,770
They invoked two different kinds of reasons,
along the lines that Andrew proposed.

614
00:46:55,710 --> 00:47:00,680
First, there was not sufficiently
informed consent, the court argued.

615
00:47:01,379 --> 00:47:04,490
"Under the contract the natural
mother is irrevocably committed

616
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,600
before she knows the strength of her bond
with her child,

617
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:11,260
she never makes a truly voluntary informed
decision for any decision

618
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:16,850
prior to the baby's birth
is in the most important sense,

619
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:18,760
uninformed," that was the court.

620
00:47:20,029 --> 00:47:24,760
Then the court also made a
version of the second argument

621
00:47:25,569 --> 00:47:32,050
against commodification in this kind
of case "this is the sale of a child,"

622
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:37,070
the court said, "or at the very least,
the sale of a mother's right to her child.

623
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,920
Whatever idealism may motivate the
participants, the profit motive predominates

624
00:47:43,259 --> 00:47:46,970
permeates, and ultimately
governs the transaction."

625
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,370
And so regardless,
the court said,

626
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:52,900
regardless of any argument
about consent or flawed consent

627
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:57,080
or full information,
there are some things in a civilized society

628
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:59,580
that money can't buy,
that's what the court said

629
00:48:00,029 --> 00:48:01,680
in voiding this contract.

630
00:48:03,629 --> 00:48:09,300
Well, what about these two arguments
against the extension of markets

631
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,030
to procreation and to reproduction?

632
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:24,740
How persuasive are they?
There was ¨C it's true, a voluntary agreement,

633
00:48:25,129 --> 00:48:27,980
a contract struck between
William Stern and Mary Beth Whitehead.

634
00:48:30,509 --> 00:48:35,140
But there are at least two ways
that consent can be other than truly free.

635
00:48:36,129 --> 00:48:41,100
First, if people are pressured
or coerced to give their agreement

636
00:48:42,339 --> 00:48:49,290
and second, if their consent
is not truly informed

637
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:56,190
and in the case of surrogacy,
the court said a mother can't know,

638
00:48:57,549 --> 00:48:59,070
even one who already
has kids of her own,

639
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:03,070
what it would be like to bear a child
and give it up for pay.

640
00:49:06,589 --> 00:49:10,440
So in order to assess criticism,
objection number one,

641
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:17,090
we have to figure out
just how free does a voluntary exchange

642
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:22,960
have to be with respect
to the bargaining power and equal information

643
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:28,800
Question number one:
how do we assess the second objection?

644
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,580
The second objection
is more elusive, it's more difficult.

645
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:38,590
Andrew acknowledged this, right?
What does it mean to say

646
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:46,760
there is something dehumanizing
to make childbearing a market transaction?

647
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:52,880
Well, one of the philosophers
we read on this subject, Elizabeth Anderson,

648
00:49:54,180 --> 00:50:01,160
tries to brings some philosophical clarity
to the unease that Andrew articulated.

649
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:08,400
She said "by requiring the surrogate mother
to repress whatever parental love

650
00:50:08,859 --> 00:50:12,470
she feels for the child,
surrogacy contracts

651
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,970
convert women's labor
into a form of alienated labor.

652
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:21,480
The surrogate's labor is alienated
because she must divert it

653
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:27,490
from the end which the social practices
of pregnancy rightly promote,

654
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:31,250
namely an emotional bond with her child."

655
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:42,850
So what Anderson is suggesting
is that certain goods should not be treated

656
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,410
as open to use or to profit.

657
00:50:46,529 --> 00:50:50,560
Certain goods are properly valued
in ways other than use.

658
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:57,400
What are other ways of valuing
and treating goods

659
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:59,700
that should not be open to use?

660
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:05,290
Anderson says there are many:
respect, appreciation,

661
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:09,600
love, honor, awe, sanctity.

662
00:51:10,589 --> 00:51:16,580
There are many modes of valuation
beyond use and certain goods

663
00:51:17,149 --> 00:51:23,400
are not properly valued
if they're treated simply as objects of use.

664
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,810
How do we go about evaluating
that argument of Anderson?

665
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:32,540
In a way, it takes us back
to the debate we had with utilitarianism.

666
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:41,790
Is utility ¨C is use the only
proper way of treating goods,

667
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,770
including life, military service,
procreation, childbearing?

668
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,840
And if not,
how do we figure out?

669
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,120
How can we determine
what modes of valuation

670
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:01,980
are fitting or appropriate
to those goods?

671
00:52:03,569 --> 00:52:06,270
Several years ago
there was a scandal surrounding a doctor,

672
00:52:07,299 --> 00:52:11,090
an infertility specialist
in Virginia named Cecil Jacobson.

673
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:17,310
He didn't have a donor catalogue
because unknown to his patients,

674
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:22,610
all of the sperm he used to inseminate
his patients came from one donor,

675
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,170
Dr. Jacobson himself.

676
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,860
At least one woman who testified in court
was unnerved at how much

677
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,570
her newborn daughter
looked just like him.

678
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:42,440
Now it's possible to condemn
Dr. Jacobson for failing

679
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:47,960
to inform the women in advance
that would be the argument about consent.

680
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:53,360
The columnist, Ellen Goodman,
described the bizarre scenario as follows,

681
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:57,300
"Dr. Jacobson," she wrote
"gave his infertility business

682
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:02,820
the personal touch
but now the rest of us,"

683
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:09,560
she wrote "are in for a round
of second thoughts about sperm donation."

684
00:53:10,779 --> 00:53:14,810
Goodman concluded that fatherhood
should be something you do,

685
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:18,520
not something you donate.
And I think what she was doing

686
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:22,880
and what the philosopher
Elizabeth Anderson is doing

687
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:27,820
and what Andrew was suggesting
with his argument about dehumanization

688
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:31,940
is pondering whether
there are certain goods

689
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:35,710
that money shouldn't buy,
not just because of tainted consent

690
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:40,960
but also perhaps because
certain goods are properly valued

691
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:44,530
in a way higher than mere use.

692
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:47,170
Those at least are the questions
we're going to pursue

693
00:53:47,819 --> 00:53:50,750
with the help of some
philosophers in the weeks to come.
