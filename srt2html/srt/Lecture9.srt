JUSTICE
with Michael Sandel

2
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,640
Arguing Affirmative Action

3
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,710
Last time,
we were discussing the distinction,

4
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,340
that Rawls draws between
two different types of claims.

5
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,730
Claims of moral desert
on the one hand,

6
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,660
and of entitlement to legitimate
expectations on the other.

7
00:00:52,690 --> 00:01:00,480
Rawls argued that
it's a mistake to think that

8
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:04,950
distributive justice is a
matter of moral desert.

9
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,350
A matter of rewarding people
according to their virtue.

10
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,470
Today we're going to
explore that question

11
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,810
of moral desert and its
relation to distributive justice.

12
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,950
Not in connection
with incoming wealth,

13
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,250
but in its connection
with opportunities.

14
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,710
With hiring decisions and
admission standards.

15
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,790
And so we turn to the case,
of affirmative action.

16
00:01:36,699 --> 00:01:38,430
You read about the case
of Cheryl Hopwood.

17
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,790
She applied for admission to the
University of Texas Law School.

18
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,900
Cheryl Hopwood had worked her
way through high school,

19
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,630
she didn't come from
an affluent family,

20
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:54,080
she put herself through
community college,

21
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:57,500
and California State
University at Sacramento.

22
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,080
She achieved a 3.8 grade
point average there,

23
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,080
later moved to Texas,
became a resident,

24
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,940
took the law school
admissions test,

25
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:10,380
did pretty well on that,

26
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,310
and she applied to the
University of Texas Law School.

27
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,470
She was turned down.

28
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,720
She was turned down at a time
when the University of Texas,

29
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,250
was using an affirmative
action admissions policy.

30
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,550
A policy that took into account,

31
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,890
race and ethnic background.

32
00:02:35,109 --> 00:02:40,500
The University of Texas said,
"40 percent of the population of Texas

33
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,890
is made up of African Americans
and Mexican Americans.

34
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:52,830
It's important that we, as a law school,
have a diverse student body.

35
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:57,060
And so we are going to
take into account,

36
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,440
not only grades and test scores,

37
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:06,180
but also the demographic makeup of our class
including, its race and ethnic profile."

38
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,090
The result, and this is what
Hopwood complained about,

39
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:12,320
the result of that policy,

40
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,810
is that some applicants to the
University of Texas Law School,

41
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,790
with a lower academic index,

42
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,900
which includes grades and test scores,

43
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,280
than hers, were admitted.

44
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:26,760
And she was turned down.

45
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,670
She said, she argued, "I'm just being
turned down because I'm white.

46
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:36,240
If I weren't, if I were a
member of a minority group,

47
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:39,120
with my grades and test scores
I would had been admitted."

48
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,950
And the statistics, the admissions
statistics that came out in the trial,

49
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:53,090
confirmed that African American and
Mexican American applicants that year,

50
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,070
who had, her grades and test scores,
were admitted.

51
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:03,180
It went to Federal Court.

52
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,520
Now, put aside the law,

53
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:10,180
let's consider it from the
standpoint of justice and morality.

54
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,610
Is it fair, or it unfair?

55
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,800
Does Cheryl Hopwood have a case?

56
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,810
A legitimate complaint?

57
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,890
Were her rights violated,
by the admissions policy of the law school?

58
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,200
How many say,
how many would rule for the law school,

59
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:34,790
and say that it was just to consider race and
ethnicity as a factor in admissions?

60
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:41,030
How many would rule
for Cheryl Hopwood

61
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,960
and say "her rights were violated?"

62
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:48,920
So here we have a pretty even split.

63
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:55,420
Alright, now I want to hear from a
defender of Cheryl Hopwood. Yes?

64
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:58,950
You're basing something
that's an arbitrary factor,

65
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,400
you know, Cheryl couldn't control
the fact that she was white,

66
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,020
or not in a minority.

67
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,510
And therefore, you know, it's not as if it
was like a test score that she worked hard

68
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,600
to try and show that she could,
you know, put that out there,

69
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,750
you know, that she had no
control over her race.

70
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,310
Good. And what're your name?
- Bree.

71
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,340
Okay. Bree, stay right there.

72
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:21,700
Now let's find someone
who has an answer for Bree.

73
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,360
Yes? - There are discrepancies
in the educational system.

74
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,780
And the majority of the time,
I know this in New York City,

75
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,800
the schools that minorities go to,
are not as well-funded,

76
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,280
are not as well-supplied,
as white schools.

77
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:38,710
And so there is going
to be a discrepancy,

78
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,950
naturally, between minorities
and between whites.

79
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,510
If they go to better schools.

80
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,830
And they will not do as well on exams
because they haven't had as much help.

81
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,600
Because of the worst
school systems.

82
00:05:49,859 --> 00:05:52,530
Let me just interrupt you to,
tell me your name?

83
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,420
Aneesha.
- Aneesha. Aneesha, you're pointing out

84
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:00,620
that minority kids may have
gone in some cases

85
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:05,400
to schools that didn't give them the same
educational opportunity as kids from

86
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,570
affluent families.
- Yes.

87
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,760
And so the test
scores they got,

88
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:16,170
may actually not represent
their true potential.

89
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:19,200
Because they didn't receive
the same kind of help

90
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:22,540
that they might have received had they
gone to a school with better funding.

91
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,480
Good, alright. Aneesha
has raised the point

92
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,330
that colleges still should choose
for the greatest academic scholarly promise

93
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,120
but in reading the test
scores and grades,

94
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,330
they should take into account
the different meaning

95
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:39,280
those tests and grades have,

96
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,790
in the light of educational
disadvantage in the background.

97
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,710
So that's one argument in defense
of affirmative action, Aneesha's argument.

98
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,160
Correcting for the effects
of unequal preparation.

99
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,250
Educational disadvantage.

100
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,400
Now, there are other arguments.

101
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:11,650
Suppose, just to identify whether
there is a competing principle here.

102
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,350
Suppose there are two candidates,

103
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,850
who did equally well on
the tests and grades.

104
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,860
Both of whom went
to first rate schools.

105
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,020
Two candidates,
among those candidates,

106
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:40,490
would it be unfair for the college
or university, for Harvard, to say,

107
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,190
"we still want diversity along racial
and ethnic dimensions,

108
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:49,730
even where we are not
correcting for the effects

109
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:52,840
on test scores of
educational disadvantage."

110
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:57,630
What about in that case, Bree?

111
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:01,020
If it's that's one thing that puts,
you know someone over the edge,

112
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,110
then it's, I guess that would be,
you know, justifiable.

113
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,930
If everything else about
the individual first, though,

114
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,740
everything to consider about that
person's you know, talents,

115
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,640
and where they come from, and who they are
without these arbitrary factors, is the same.

116
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,560
Without these 'arbitrary factors',
you call them.

117
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:22,910
But before you were suggesting, Bree,
that race and ethnicity are arbitrary factors

118
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,080
outside the control of the applicants.
- True, I would agree with that.

119
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:31,240
And your general principle is that admissions
shouldn't reward arbitrary factors,

120
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,810
over which people have no control.
- Right.

121
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,770
Alright. Who else, who else
would like to, thank you both.

122
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,810
Who else would like to get
into this, what do you say?

123
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,620
Well, first of all, I'm for
affirmative action temporarily,

124
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:47,130
but, for two reasons.

125
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,350
First of all, you have to
look at the university's purpose.

126
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,970
It is to educate their students.

127
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,980
And I feel that different races,
people coming from different races have

128
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,580
different backgrounds and they
contribute differently to the education.

129
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,630
And second of all, when you say
that they have equal backgrounds,

130
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,330
that's not true when you look
at the broader picture,

131
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,540
and you look at slavery
and this is kind of a reparation.

132
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,740
I think affirmative action is a temporary
solution to alleviate history,

133
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,490
and the wrongs done to
African Americans in particular.

134
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:20,880
And what's your name?

135
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:23,670
David.
- David. You say that affirmative action

136
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,880
is justified at least for now as a way
of compensating for past injustice.

137
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,090
The legacy of slavery and segregation.
- Right.

138
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,970
Who wants to take
on that argument?

139
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,040
We need now a critic
of affirmative action.

140
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,190
Yes, go ahead.

141
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,150
I think that what happened in the past
has no bearing on what happens today.

142
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,550
I think that discriminating based
on race should always be wrong.

143
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,740
Whether you're discriminating
against one group or another.

144
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,590
Just because our ancestors
did something,

145
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:59,440
doesn't mean that that should have any
effect on what happens with us today.

146
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,740
Alright, good. I'm sorry, your name is?
- Kate.

147
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,780
Kate. Alright, who has
an answer for Kate?

148
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,150
Yes.
- I just wanted to comment

149
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,330
and say that,
- Tell us your name.

150
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:19,450
My name is Mansur. Because of slavery,
because of past injustices today,

151
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,280
we have a higher proportion of African
Americans who are in poverty,

152
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,050
who face less opportunities
than white people.

153
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,770
So because of slavery 200 years ago,

154
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,110
and because of Jim Crow,
and because of segregation,

155
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:35,750
today we have injustice based on race.

156
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,640
Kate?
- I think that there are differences,

157
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,810
obviously, but the way to fix those
differences is not by some artificial fixing

158
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,140
of the result.

159
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,110
You need to fix the problem.

160
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,540
So we need to address
differences in education,

161
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:55,330
and differences in upbringing
with programs like Head Start,

162
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,450
and giving more funding
to lower income schools

163
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,530
rather than just trying
to fix the result,

164
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,150
so it makes it look like it's
equal when it's really it isn't.

165
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,500
Yes.

166
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:07,460
Well, with regard to affirmative
action based on race,

167
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,250
I just want to say that white people
have had their own affirmative action

168
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,300
in this country for
more than 400 years.

169
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,800
It's called 'nepotism' and 'quid pro quo'.

170
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,770
So there's nothing wrong with correcting
the injustice and discrimination

171
00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:20,000
that's been done to black
people for 400 years.

172
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,440
Good. Tell us your name.
- Hannah.

173
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,610
Hannah. Alright who has
an answer for Hannah?

174
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,290
And just to add
to Hannah's point,

175
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,580
because we need now
someone to respond,

176
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,930
Hannah, you could have
also mentioned legacy admissions.

177
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:41,420
Exactly.
I was going to say,

178
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,090
if you disagree
with affirmative action,

179
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,890
you should disagree with
legacy admission because

180
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,690
it's obvious from looking around here
that there are more white legacies

181
00:11:47,969 --> 00:11:49,910
than black legacies in the
history of Harvard University.

182
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:52,700
And explain what legacy admissions are.

183
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,060
Well, legacy admissions is giving
an advantage to someone

184
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:59,750
who has an arbitrary privilege of their
parent having attended the university

185
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:00,900
to which they're applying.

186
00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:04,230
Alright, so a reply for Hannah.

187
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:09,320
Yes, in the balcony, go ahead.

188
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:14,340
First of all, if affirmative action
is making up for past injustice,

189
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,040
how do you explain minorities that were
not historically discriminated against

190
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,090
in the United States who
get these advantages?

191
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,570
In addition, you could argue
that affirmative action perpetuates

192
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,010
divisions between the races rather
than achieve the ultimate goal

193
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,420
of race being an irrelevant
factor in our society.

194
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:33,610
And what, tell us your name.

195
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,280
Danielle.
- Hannah.

196
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:38,870
I disagree with that because
I think that by promoting diversity

197
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:40,670
in an institution like this,

198
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:44,250
you further educate all of the students,
especially the white students

199
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:46,200
who grew up in predominately
white areas.

200
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:50,040
It's certainly a form of education to be
exposed to people from different backgrounds.

201
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,210
And you put white students at an inherent
disadvantage when you surround them

202
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,640
only with their own kind.

203
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:57,910
Why should race necessarily
be equated with diversity?

204
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,950
There are so many other forms,
why should we assume

205
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:01,380
that race makes people different?

206
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:05,510
Again, that's perpetuating the idea of
racial division within our universities

207
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,410
and our society.
- Hannah?

208
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,630
With regard to
African American people

209
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,430
being given a special advantage,

210
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,610
it's obvious that they bring
something special to the table,

211
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,620
because they have a
unique perspective

212
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,810
just as someone from a different religion or
socio-economic background would, as well.

213
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,780
As you say, there are many
different types of diversity.

214
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:28,680
There's no reason that racial diversity
should be eliminated from that criteria.

215
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:31,710
Yes, go ahead.

216
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,580
Racial discrimination
is illegal in this country,

217
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,210
and I believe that it was African
American leaders themselves,

218
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,050
when Martin Luther King said he wanted to
be judged not on the color of skin,

219
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:44,850
but by the content of his character,
his merit, his achievements.

220
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:49,960
And I just think that,
to decide solely based on someone's race

221
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,110
is just inherently unfair.

222
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,820
I mean, if you want to correct based
on disadvantaged backgrounds,

223
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,140
that's fine, but there are also
disadvantaged white people as well.

224
00:13:59,469 --> 00:14:02,010
It shouldn't matter if you're white or black.
- Tell us your name.

225
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,830
Ted. - Ted, - Yes.
- Think of Hopwood.

226
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:13,190
It's unfair to count race or, I assume
you would also say, ethnicity or religion?

227
00:14:14,099 --> 00:14:17,190
Yes. - Do you think she has
a right to be considered

228
00:14:17,469 --> 00:14:20,450
according to her grades
and test scores alone?

229
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,240
No. There is more
to it than that.

230
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,290
Universities need
to promote diversity.

231
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,140
So you agree with the goal
of promoting diversity?

232
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,050
There's ways to promote diversity besides
discriminating against people solely

233
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:38,420
based on a factor they cannot control.

234
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,460
Alright, so what makes it wrong,

235
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,990
is that she can't
control her race.

236
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,730
She can't control the
fact that she's white.

237
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,970
That's the heart of
the unfairness to her.

238
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,980
Bree made a similar point.

239
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,830
That basing admissions on factors
that people can't control,

240
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,420
is fundamentally unfair.
What do you say?

241
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,090
There's a lot of things
you can't control,

242
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,360
and if you don't
for it based on merit,

243
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,780
like just based on
your test scores,

244
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,670
a lot of what you can achieve has
to do with family background,

245
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,630
that you were raised in.

246
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:12,540
If both of your parents
were scholarly,

247
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:14,320
then you have more of
chance of actually

248
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:17,300
of being more scholarly yourself
and getting those grades.

249
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,830
And you can't control what kind
of family you were born into.

250
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,310
Alright good, that's a great
rejoinder, what's your name?

251
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,000
Da.
- Da.

252
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:32,520
Ted, are you against advantages that come
from the family you were born into?

253
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,950
What about legacy admissions?

254
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:38,090
I do believe that in terms
of a legacy admission

255
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,510
you shouldn't have
a special preference,

256
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:44,540
I mean there is a legacy admission you
could argue is another part,

257
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,420
versus you could day it's
important to have a small percentage

258
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,500
of people that have a several generation
family attendance at a place like Harvard.

259
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:58,070
However that should not be
an advantage factor like race,

260
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,000
it should just be another part
promoting diversity.

261
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,280
Should it count at all?

262
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,540
I think that,
- Alumni status, should it count at all, Ted?

263
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,780
Yes. It should count.

264
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,380
Alright, I want to step back for a
moment from these arguments.

265
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:15,760
Thank you all for
these contributions.

266
00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:17,060
We're going to come
back to you.

267
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,190
If you've listened carefully
I think you will have noticed

268
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,560
three different arguments
emerge from this discussion.

269
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:30,880
In defense of considering
race and ethnicity

270
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:34,510
as a factor in admissions.

271
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:41,800
One argument has to do
with correcting for the effects,

272
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,410
for the effects of
educational disadvantage.

273
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:49,950
That was Aneesha's argument.

274
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:53,420
This is what we might call
the corrective argument.

275
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:57,870
Correcting for differences
in educational background,

276
00:16:57,969 --> 00:16:59,280
the kind of school
people went to.

277
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,680
The opportunities they
had and so on.

278
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,460
That's one argument.

279
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,060
What's worth noticing though,
is that argument is consistent

280
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,020
in principle with the idea

281
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,080
that only academic promise and scholarly
potential should count in admissions.

282
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:21,090
We just need to go beyond
test scores and grades alone,

283
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,050
to get a true estimate

284
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,630
of academic promise
and scholarly ability.

285
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,540
That's the first argument.

286
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,860
Then we heard a second
argument that said

287
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:38,750
affirmative action is justified
even where there may not be

288
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:44,500
the need to correct for
educational disadvantage

289
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,870
in a particular applicant's case.

290
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,470
It's justified as a way of
compensating for past wrongs,

291
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,430
for historic injustices.

292
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,670
So that's a compensatory argument.

293
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,280
Compensating for past wrongs.

294
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,510
Then we heard, a third,
a different argument,

295
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:12,420
for affirmative action,
from Hannah and others,

296
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,150
that argued in the name of diversity.

297
00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:23,520
Now, the diversity argument is different
from the compensatory argument,

298
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:29,320
because it makes a certain
appeal to the social purpose

299
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,610
or the social mission
of the college or university.

300
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,230
There are really two aspects
to the diversity argument.

301
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:43,010
One says it's important to have a
diverse student body for the sake of

302
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,280
the educational
experience for everyone.

303
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:47,010
Hannah made that point.

304
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:51,110
And the other talks
about the wider society.

305
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:55,370
This was the argument made by
the University of Texas in the Hopwood case.

306
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,730
We need to train lawyers
and judges and leaders,

307
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:06,650
public officials who will
contribute to the strength,

308
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:11,350
the civic strength of the state of
Texas, and the country as a whole.

309
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,800
So there are two different aspects
to the diversity argument.

310
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,950
But both are arguments in the name
of the social purpose,

311
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,100
or the social mission or
the common good,

312
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:23,370
served by the institution.

313
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,230
Well, what about the force
of these arguments?

314
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,900
We've also heard objections
to these arguments.

315
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:36,620
The most powerful objection to the
compensatory argument is,

316
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:40,840
is it fair to ask Cheryl
Hopwood today,

317
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:45,810
to make the sacrifice,
to pay the compensation

318
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,040
for an injustice that was admittedly
committed and egregious,

319
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:53,490
in the past,
but in which she was not implicated.

320
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,420
Is that fair?

321
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,320
So that's an important objection

322
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:00,850
to the compensatory argument.

323
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,920
And in order to meet that objection,

324
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,750
we would have to investigate
whether there is such a thing

325
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,630
as group rights or
collective responsibility

326
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,420
that reaches over time.

327
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,060
So having identified that issue,

328
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:18,980
let's set it aside to
turn to the diversity argument.

329
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:26,220
The diversity argument doesn't
have to worry about that question.

330
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,910
About collective responsibility
for past wrongs.

331
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,520
Because it says, for reasons
Hannah and others pointed out,

332
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,410
that the common good is served,

333
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:48,300
is advanced if there is a racially
and ethnically diverse student body.

334
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,730
Everyone benefits.

335
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:53,440
This indeed was the
argument that Harvard made

336
00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:01,020
when it filed a friend of the court brief
to the Supreme Court in the 1978 case,

337
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:03,790
the affirmative action case,
the Bakke case.

338
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,550
In the Harvard brief,
the Harvard rationale,

339
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:11,460
was cited by Justice Powell,

340
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:14,340
who was the swing vote in the case
upholding affirmative action,

341
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,810
he cited that as providing
the rationale that he thought

342
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:20,970
was constitutionally acceptable.

343
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,690
Harvard's argument
in its brief, was this:

344
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:35,410
"We care about diversity.
Scholarly excellence alone, has never been

345
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:39,890
the criterion of admission, the sole
criterion of admission to Harvard College.

346
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:45,630
Fifteen years ago diversity meant
students from California and New York,

347
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,980
and Massachusetts.
City dwellers, and farm boys.

348
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:51,850
Violinists, painters and football players.

349
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,360
Biologists, historians and classicists.

350
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,540
The only difference now,

351
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:02,040
Harvard argued, is that we're adding racial
and ethnic status to this long list

352
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:03,710
of diversity considerations.

353
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,440
When reviewing the large number of
candidates able to do well in our classes,"

354
00:22:09,189 --> 00:22:14,890
Harvard wrote, "Race may count as a plus,
just as coming from Iowa may count

355
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,330
or being a good middle
linebacker or pianist.

356
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,750
A farm boy from Idaho can bring
something to Harvard College

357
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,160
that a Bostonian cannot offer.

358
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,220
Similarly, a black student can usually bring
something a white student cannot offer.

359
00:22:31,389 --> 00:22:34,240
The quality of the educational
experience of all students

360
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:37,330
depends in part on these differences

361
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:41,580
in the background and outlook
that students bring with them."

362
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,090
That was Harvard's argument.

363
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,160
Now what about the diversity argument?

364
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,960
Is it persuasive?

365
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,100
If it's to be persuasive, it has to
meet one very powerful objection.

366
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:56,970
That we've heard voiced here.

367
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,730
By Ted,
by Bree.

368
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:09,410
Unless you're a utilitarian, you believe
that individual rights can't be violated.

369
00:23:13,189 --> 00:23:14,190
And so the question is,

370
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,020
is there an individual right
that is violated?

371
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,520
Is Cheryl Hopwood's right violated?

372
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:26,230
If she is used, so to speak,
denied admission,

373
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:30,310
for the sake of the common good
and the social mission

374
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:34,280
that the University of Texas
Law School has defined for itself,

375
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,210
does she have a right?

376
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,380
Don't we deserve to be considered

377
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,260
according to our excellences,
our achievements,

378
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,690
our accomplishments,
our hard work?

379
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,200
Isn't that the right at stake?

380
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:53,520
Now we've already heard
an answer to that argument.

381
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,610
No, she doesn't
have the right.

382
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,200
Nobody deserves to be admitted.

383
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,190
Notice how this gets us back to the
issue of desert versus entitlement.

384
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:08,730
They're arguing there is no
individual right that Hopwood has.

385
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:13,930
She doesn't deserve to be admitted according
to any particular set of criteria that

386
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,650
she believes to be important.

387
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,080
Including criteria that have only to
do with her efforts and achievements.

388
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,130
Why not?

389
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:26,130
I think implicit,
in this argument,

390
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:34,410
is something like Rawls' rejection of moral
desert as the basis of distributive justice.

391
00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:40,630
Yes, once Harvard
defines its mission

392
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:44,940
and designs its admission
policy in the light of its mission,

393
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,800
people are entitled,
who fit those criteria,

394
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,760
they are entitled to be admitted.

395
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,520
But according to this argument,

396
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:59,490
no one deserves that
Harvard college define its mission

397
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,720
and design its admission
criteria in the first place,

398
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:07,850
in a way that prizes the qualities
they happen to have in abundance.

399
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,690
Whether those qualities
are test scores or grades

400
00:25:11,129 --> 00:25:12,600
or the ability to play the piano,

401
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,030
or to be a good middle linebacker,

402
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,060
or to come from Iowa,

403
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:20,310
or to come from a certain minority group.

404
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,040
So you see how this
debate about affirmative action,

405
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,240
especially the diversity argument,

406
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:31,460
takes us back to the
question of rights,

407
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,330
which in turn takes us back to
the question of whether moral desert

408
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:42,560
is or is not the basis
for distributive justice.

409
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,840
Think about that over the weekend and
we'll continue this discussion next time.

410
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,040
Suppose we're distributing flutes.

411
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,170
Who should get the best ones?

412
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:02,500
What's Aristotle's answer?
Anyone?

413
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,000
His answer is, the best flutes
should go to the best flute players,

414
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,590
because that's what flutes are for.

415
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:22,510
When we ended last time,

416
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:27,700
we were considering arguments for
and against affirmative action.

417
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,910
Counting race as a factor in admissions.

418
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,070
And, in the course of the discussion,

419
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,550
three arguments emerged,

420
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,650
three arguments for affirmative action.

421
00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:47,210
One of them was the idea that race
and ethnic background should count

422
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:55,100
as a way of correcting for the true
meaning of test scores and grades.

423
00:26:57,629 --> 00:27:01,470
Getting a more accurate
measure of the academic potential

424
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,530
those scores,
those numbers represent.

425
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:09,790
Second, was what we called
"the compensatory argument".

426
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:17,130
The idea of righting past wrongs,
past injustice.

427
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:20,410
And the third was the diversity argument.

428
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,080
And when Cheryl Hopwood
in the 1990s challenged

429
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,680
the University of Texas Law School's
affirmative action program,

430
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:34,260
in the federal courts,
the University of Texas

431
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,900
made another version of
the diversity argument.

432
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,490
Saying that the broader social purpose, the
social mission of the University of Texas

433
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:49,410
Law School, is to produce leaders,
in the legal community,

434
00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:53,620
in the political community,
among judges, lawyers, legislators,

435
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:59,290
and therefore it's important
that we produce leaders,

436
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,530
who reflect the background,
and the experience,

437
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,500
and the ethnic and the racial
composition of the state of Texas.

438
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:15,350
It's important for serving
our wider social mission.

439
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,330
That was the University of
Texas Law School's argument.

440
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:23,580
And then we considered an objection

441
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,140
to the diversity argument which after
all is an argument in the name of

442
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:33,010
the social mission,
the common good.

443
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,550
We saw that Rawls does
not simply believe

444
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,630
that arguments of the common good
or the general welfare should prevail

445
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:48,470
if individual rights must be violated in
the course of promoting the common good.

446
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,820
You remember that was the question,
the challenge,

447
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,400
to the diversity rationale
that we were considering

448
00:28:56,149 --> 00:28:58,190
when we finished last time.

449
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,770
And we began to discuss the question
"Well, what right might be at stake"?

450
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:15,270
Maybe the right to be considered
according to factors within one's control.

451
00:29:16,939 --> 00:29:21,390
Maybe this is the argument that
Cheryl Hopwood implicitly was making.

452
00:29:23,209 --> 00:29:25,960
She can't help the
fact that she is white.

453
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,120
Why should her chance
at getting into law school

454
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,300
depend on a factor she can't control?

455
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:39,760
And then Hannah who is
advancing an argument last time

456
00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:45,630
said Harvard has the right
to define its mission

457
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,660
any way it wants to,
it's a private institution.

458
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,310
And it's only once
Harvard defines its mission

459
00:29:54,610 --> 00:30:01,250
that we can identify
the qualities that count.

460
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,360
So no rights are being violated.

461
00:30:05,949 --> 00:30:08,720
Now, what about
that argument?

462
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:13,740
What I would like to do is to
hear objections to that reply.

463
00:30:14,129 --> 00:30:17,140
And then, see whether
others have an answer.

464
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,610
Yes?
And tell us your name.

465
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,490
Da.
- Da, right you spoke up last time.

466
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,640
How do you answer that argument?

467
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,680
Well, I think there was
two things in there.

468
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:32,240
One of them was that a private institution
could define its mission however it wants.

469
00:30:32,879 --> 00:30:37,140
But that doesn't make however it defines it,
right, like I could define my personal

470
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,710
mission as I want to collect all
the money in the world.

471
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:41,850
But does that make it
even a good mission?

472
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:46,660
So you can't like, you can't say that just
because a college is a private institution it

473
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,410
can just define it as whatever it wants,

474
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:51,150
you still have to thing about, what
are the way it's defining it, it's right.

475
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:55,320
And the case of affirmative action
a lot of people have said that

476
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,830
since there's a lot
of other factors involved,

477
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,560
why not race?

478
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:04,000
Like if we already know that,
- Let's I want to stick with your first

479
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,070
point, Da.
- Okay.

480
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:06,840
Here's Da's objection.

481
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:12,230
Can a college or university define
its social purpose any way it wants to

482
00:31:12,689 --> 00:31:16,510
and define admissions
criteria accordingly?

483
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:21,890
What about the
University of Texas Law School

484
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,260
not today, but in the 1950s?

485
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:30,720
Then, there was
another Supreme Court case,

486
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:36,150
against the admissions policy of the
University of Texas Law School

487
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,270
because it was segregated.

488
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,300
It only admitted whites.

489
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,560
And when the case went to
court back in the '50s,

490
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,220
the University of Texas Law School
also invoked its mission.

491
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,830
"Our mission as a law school,

492
00:31:54,590 --> 00:32:00,050
is to educate lawyers
for the Texas bar, the Texas law firms.

493
00:32:01,459 --> 00:32:05,300
And no Texas law firm hires
African Americans.

494
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,200
So to fulfill our mission,

495
00:32:09,689 --> 00:32:11,340
we only admit whites."

496
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:16,070
Or consider Harvard,

497
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:17,610
in the 1930s

498
00:32:19,149 --> 00:32:23,150
when it had anti-Jewish quotas.

499
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,660
President Lowell, the president
of Harvard in the 1930s said,

500
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,330
that he had nothing
personally against Jews,

501
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:39,340
but he invoked the mission,
the social purpose of Harvard he said,

502
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,100
"which is not only
to train intellectuals,

503
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:49,190
part of the mission at Harvard," he said,
"is to train stockbrokers for Wall Street,

504
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:54,340
presidents and senators and there are
very few Jews who go into those professions."

505
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,060
Now, here's the challenge.

506
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:02,640
Is there a principle distinction

507
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,070
between the invocation of
the social purpose

508
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,350
of the college or university today,

509
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,440
in the diversity rationale

510
00:33:14,139 --> 00:33:16,910
and the invocation of the
social purpose or mission

511
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,310
of the university by
Texas in the 1950s

512
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,710
or Harvard in the 1930s?

513
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,850
Is there a difference in principle?

514
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:27,360
What's the reply?

515
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,490
Hannah?
- Well, I think that the principle that's

516
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:38,040
different here, is, basically the distinction
between inclusion versus exclusion.

517
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:41,800
I think that it's morally
wrong of the university to

518
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:46,870
say "We're going to exclude you on
the basis of your religion or your race."

519
00:33:47,209 --> 00:33:49,090
That's denial on the
basis of arbitrary factors.

520
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,260
What Harvard is trying to do
today with its diversity initiatives,

521
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:55,890
is to include groups that
were excluded in the past.

522
00:33:56,169 --> 00:34:00,980
Good, let's see if, stay there, let's see
if someone would like to reply.

523
00:34:01,969 --> 00:34:05,580
Go ahead. - Actually this is
kind of in support of Hannah,

524
00:34:06,139 --> 00:34:07,840
rather than a reply but,
- That's alright.

525
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:09,520
I was going to say
another principle difference

526
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:14,960
can be based on malice being
the motivation for the historical

527
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:20,200
segregation act, so it's saying that we're
not going to let blacks or Jews in because

528
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,330
they're worse as
people or as a group.

529
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,730
Good, so the element of
malice isn't present.

530
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,390
And what's your name?
- Stevie.

531
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:37,080
Stevie says that in the historic segregation
as racist, anti-Semitic quotas

532
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,690
or prohibitions.

533
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,460
There was built into them,

534
00:34:42,799 --> 00:34:44,630
a certain kind of malice,
a certain kind of judgment

535
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:52,200
that African Americans or Jews were
somehow less worthy than everybody else.

536
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,320
Whereas present day
affirmative action programs

537
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:01,270
don't involve or imply
any such judgment.

538
00:35:02,049 --> 00:35:05,870
What it amounts to saying is,
so long as the policy,

539
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:16,810
just uses people in a way as
valuable to the social purpose

540
00:35:18,029 --> 00:35:22,340
of the institution, it's okay
provided it doesn't judge them,

541
00:35:22,819 --> 00:35:25,150
maliciously, as Stevie might add,

542
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,680
as intrinsically less worthy.

543
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:32,930
I'd like to raise a question.

544
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:39,070
Doesn't that
concede that all of us

545
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:46,220
when we compete for positions or
for seats in colleges and universities

546
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,140
in a way are being used, not judged,

547
00:35:53,040 --> 00:36:01,040
but used, in a way that has
nothing to do with moral desert.

548
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:06,130
Remember we got into this
whole discussion of affirmative action

549
00:36:07,069 --> 00:36:08,150
when we were
trying to figure out

550
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:14,910
whether distributive justice should
be tied to moral desert or not.

551
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,490
And we were launched
on that question

552
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,880
by Rawls and his denial,

553
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,190
his rejection of the idea
that distributive justice

554
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,470
whether its positions or places
in the class or income and wealth

555
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,700
is a matter of moral desert.

556
00:36:37,339 --> 00:36:41,000
Suppose that were the moral basis
of Harvard's admissions policy,

557
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,490
what letters would they have to write

558
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,850
to people they rejected or
accepted for that matter?

559
00:36:51,759 --> 00:36:53,120
Wouldn't they have
to write something like this:

560
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:54,820
"Dear unsuccessful applicant,

561
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,470
we regret to inform you
that your application for admission

562
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:00,810
has been rejected.

563
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,130
It's not your fault that
when you came along

564
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:06,810
society happened not to need
the qualities you had to offer.

565
00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:11,180
Those admitted instead of
you are not themselves

566
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:17,080
deserving of a place nor worthy of a praise
for the factors that led their admission.

567
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:22,360
We are in any case only using them and you
as instruments of a wider social purpose.

568
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:25,570
Better luck next time."

569
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,570
What was the letter
you actually got

570
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,370
when you were admitted?

571
00:37:33,009 --> 00:37:34,710
Perhaps it should have read
something like this:

572
00:37:36,009 --> 00:37:37,970
"Dear successful applicant,

573
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,890
we are pleased to inform you that your
application for admission has been accepted.

574
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:46,230
It turns out,
lucky for you,

575
00:37:47,529 --> 00:37:50,230
that you have the traits that
society needs at the moment,

576
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,920
so we propose to
exploit your assets

577
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,650
for society's advantage.

578
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,390
You are to be congratulated.

579
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:00,600
Not in the sense that you deserve
credit for having the qualities

580
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,930
that led to your admission,

581
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,850
but only in a sense that
the winner of a lottery

582
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,180
is to be congratulated.

583
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,680
And if you choose
to accept our offer,

584
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,350
you will ultimately be entitled
to the benefits that attach

585
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,150
to being used in this way.

586
00:38:15,799 --> 00:38:17,890
We look forward to
seeing you in the fall."

587
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,440
Now, there is something a little odd,

588
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:23,640
morally odd,

589
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:30,060
if it's true that those
letters do reflect

590
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,570
the theory,
the philosophy

591
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,350
underlying the policy.

592
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,170
So here's the question they pose.

593
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:46,500
And it's a question that takes us back
to a big issue in political philosophy.

594
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,690
Is it possible,
and is it desirable,

595
00:38:52,759 --> 00:38:57,020
to detach questions
of distributive justice

596
00:38:58,299 --> 00:39:00,000
from questions of moral desert

597
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:02,660
and questions of virtue?

598
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,330
In many ways,

599
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:13,240
this is an issue that separates
modern political philosophy from

600
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,280
ancient political thought.

601
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:22,750
What's at stake in the question of whether
we can put desert, moral desert aside?

602
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,730
It seemed when we
were reading Rawls,

603
00:39:27,609 --> 00:39:30,020
that the incentive,
the reason he had,

604
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,490
for detaching distributive
justice from moral desert

605
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,440
was an egalitarian one.

606
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,090
That if we set desert to one side,

607
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,120
there's greater scope for the
exercise of egalitarian considerations.

608
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,130
The veil of ignorance.

609
00:39:46,549 --> 00:39:48,670
The two principles,
the difference principle,

610
00:39:49,049 --> 00:39:52,010
helping the least well off,
redistribution and all that.

611
00:39:54,069 --> 00:39:56,430
But what's interesting,
is if you look,

612
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,190
at a range of thinkers
we've been considering,

613
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:07,580
there does seem to be a reason they
want to detach justice from desert

614
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,820
that goes well beyond
any concern for equality.

615
00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:15,100
Libertarian rights oriented theorists,

616
00:40:16,589 --> 00:40:21,270
the kind we've been studying, as well
as egalitarian rights oriented theorists,

617
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:26,280
including Rawls, and for that
matter, also including Kant,

618
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:32,480
all agree, despite their disagreements
over distributive justice,

619
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,610
and the welfare state
and all of that,

620
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:43,390
they all agree that justice is not
a matter of rewarding or honoring

621
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:46,740
virtue or moral desert.

622
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,830
Now why do they all think that?

623
00:40:49,109 --> 00:40:51,780
It can't just be
for egalitarian reasons

624
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,630
not all of them are egalitarians.

625
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,530
This gets us to the big philosophical
question we have to try to sort out.

626
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:06,150
Somehow they think tying
justice to moral merit or virtue

627
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:11,290
is going to lead away from freedom,

628
00:41:11,779 --> 00:41:14,080
from respect for
persons as free beings.

629
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:21,010
Well, in order to see what they
consider to be at stake,

630
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,370
and in order to assess
their shared assumption,

631
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:29,550
we need to turn to a thinker,
to a philosopher,

632
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,640
who disagrees with them.

633
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:39,320
Who explicitly ties justice
to honor, honoring virtue,

634
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:44,100
and merit and moral desert.

635
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:48,050
And that thinker
is Aristotle.

636
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:54,450
Now, in many ways
Aristotle's idea of justice

637
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:56,720
is intuitively very powerful.

638
00:41:58,069 --> 00:41:59,460
In some ways it's strange.

639
00:42:00,529 --> 00:42:04,660
I want to bring out both its power,
its plausibility and its strangeness,

640
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,160
so that we can see what's at
stake in this whole debate about

641
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,290
justice and whether it's
tied to desert and virtue.

642
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:21,910
So, what is Aristotle's answer
to the question about justice?

643
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,850
For Aristotle, justice is a matter of
giving people what they deserve,

644
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,280
giving people their due.

645
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,170
It's a matter of figuring out
the proper fit

646
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:35,540
between persons,
with their virtues,

647
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,870
and their appropriate social roles.

648
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:44,110
Well, what does this picture
of justice look like,

649
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,290
and how does it differ from the
conception that seems to be shared among

650
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:53,300
libertarian and egalitarian
rights oriented theorists alike?

651
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,890
Justice means giving each person

652
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,050
his or her due, giving
people what they deserve.

653
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:03,850
But what is a person's due?

654
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,190
What are the relevant
grounds of merit or desert?

655
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:12,110
Aristotle says that depends on
the sort of things being distributed.

656
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:18,720
"Justice involves two factors:
Things and the persons

657
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:21,050
to whom the things are assigned.

658
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:26,130
In general we say," Aristotle writes,
"That persons who are equal

659
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:29,060
should have equal things
assigned to them."

660
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:33,300
But here there arises a hard question.

661
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,300
Equals in what respects?

662
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,390
Aristotle says that depends on the
sort of thing we're distributing.

663
00:43:43,029 --> 00:43:45,280
Suppose we're distributing flutes.

664
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:52,600
What is the relevant merit or
basis of desert for flutes?

665
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,710
Who should get the best ones?

666
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:56,990
What's Aristotle's answer?

667
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:58,450
Anyone?

668
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:04,660
The best flute players, right.

669
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,960
Those who are best in
the relevant sense,

670
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:09,030
the best flute players.

671
00:44:10,379 --> 00:44:14,220
Is it just to discriminate
in allocating flutes? Yes.

672
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,390
All justice involves discrimination,
Aristotle says.

673
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,470
What matters is that the
discrimination be according to the relevant

674
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,350
excellence,
according to the virtue

675
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:30,760
appropriate to having flutes.

676
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:36,850
He says it would be unjust to
discriminate on some other basis.

677
00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:41,400
In giving out the flutes,
to, say, wealth.

678
00:44:43,299 --> 00:44:46,520
Just giving the best flutes to the
people who can pay the highest price,

679
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,770
or nobility of birth,
just giving flutes to aristocrats,

680
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:55,010
or physical beauty, giving the
best flutes to the most handsome,

681
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,220
or chance, having a lottery.

682
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:04,310
Aristotle says birth and
beauty may be greater

683
00:45:04,609 --> 00:45:06,470
goods than the ability to play the flute,

684
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:12,850
and those who possess them may surpass
the flute player more in these qualities

685
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,890
than he surpasses them
in his flute playing.

686
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:21,000
But the fact remains that he is the person
who ought to get the best flute.

687
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,470
It's a strange idea this comparison,
by the way,

688
00:45:26,009 --> 00:45:30,610
that could you say,
"Am I more handsome

689
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:33,530
than she is a good lacrosse player?"

690
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:36,830
That's a strange kind of comparison.

691
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,630
But putting that aside,

692
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:43,640
Aristotle says, we're not looking for
the best overall whatever that might mean.

693
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,210
We're looking for the best musician.

694
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:49,310
Now, why this is important to see.

695
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:52,710
Why, should the best flutes
go to the best flute players?

696
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:58,930
Well, why do you think?

697
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:01,720
Anybody?

698
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,070
What?
They'll produce the best music.

699
00:46:09,109 --> 00:46:12,070
Well, and everybody will enjoy it more.

700
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:14,630
That's not Aristotle's answer.

701
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,540
Aristotle is not a utilitarian.

702
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:23,640
He's not just saying, that way there'll be
better music and everyone will enjoy it,

703
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:24,840
everyone will be better off.

704
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:29,070
His answer is the best flutes
should go to the best flute players

705
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:33,750
because that's what flutes are for.

706
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,560
To be played well.

707
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:42,260
The purpose of flute playing,
the purpose,

708
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,540
is to produce excellent music.

709
00:46:45,129 --> 00:46:47,540
And those who can
best perfect that purpose,

710
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:52,660
ought properly to have the best ones.

711
00:46:53,049 --> 00:46:54,470
Now, it may also be true,

712
00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:57,020
as a welcome side effect.

713
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,640
That everyone will enjoy
listening to that music.

714
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,400
So that answer is true enough
as far as it goes,

715
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,910
but it's important to
see that Aristotle's

716
00:47:05,379 --> 00:47:07,110
reason is not a utilitarian reason.

717
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,860
It's a reason that looks,

718
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:11,760
here's where you might think
it's a little bit strange,

719
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,980
it looks to the purpose, the point,
the goal, of flute playing.

720
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,080
Another way of describing this,

721
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,030
looking to the goal to determine

722
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,380
the just allocation,

723
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,510
the Greek for goal or end,
was 'telos'.

724
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:37,930
So Aristotle says, you have to
consider the point, the end, the goal,

725
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:41,850
the telos of the thing in
this case of flute playing.

726
00:47:43,879 --> 00:47:47,590
And that's how you
define a just allocation.

727
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,080
A just discrimination.

728
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:52,970
So this idea of
reasoning from the goal,

729
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:58,470
from the telos, is called
"teleological reasoning".

730
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:02,170
Teleological moral reasoning.

731
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,000
And that's Aristotle's way.

732
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,640
Reasoning from the goal,
from the end.

733
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,540
Now, this may seem,
as I said a strange idea,

734
00:48:15,279 --> 00:48:16,850
that we're supposed to
reason from the purpose,

735
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:20,950
but it is, does have a certain
intuitive plausibility.

736
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:28,550
Consider the allocation, let's say, at
Harvard, of the best tennis courts

737
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,340
or squash courts.

738
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:33,520
How should they be allocated?
Who should have priority in playing

739
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,710
on the best courts?

740
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,720
Well, you might say,

741
00:48:40,589 --> 00:48:43,130
"Those who can best afford them."

742
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:46,110
Set up a fee system,
charge money for them.

743
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,650
Aristotle would say "No".

744
00:48:48,879 --> 00:48:50,160
You might say,

745
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,120
"Well, Harvard big shots, the most
influential people at Harvard,

746
00:48:56,529 --> 00:48:57,160
who would they be"?

747
00:48:59,089 --> 00:49:00,870
The senior faculty should have priority

748
00:49:03,299 --> 00:49:05,110
in playing on the best tennis courts.

749
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,760
No, Aristotle would reject that.

750
00:49:09,299 --> 00:49:16,540
Some scientist may be a greater scientist
than some Varsity tennis player

751
00:49:17,009 --> 00:49:19,360
is a tennis player, but still
the tennis player is the one

752
00:49:19,779 --> 00:49:25,320
who should have priority
for playing in the best tennis court.

753
00:49:27,279 --> 00:49:30,370
There is a certain
intuitive plausibility to this idea.

754
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:32,870
Now, one of the things
that makes it strange

755
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:36,740
is that in Aristotle's world,
in the ancient world,

756
00:49:37,799 --> 00:49:39,320
it wasn't only social practices

757
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:43,420
that were governed,
in Aristotle's view,

758
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:49,040
by teleological reasoning
and teleological explanation.

759
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,270
All of nature

760
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:56,460
was understood to be a meaningful order

761
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:58,550
and what it meant to understand nature,

762
00:49:58,879 --> 00:50:01,210
to grasp nature,
to find our place in nature,

763
00:50:01,779 --> 00:50:06,460
was to inquire into and read out
the purposes or the telos,

764
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:08,630
of nature.

765
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:13,880
And with the advent of modern science, it's
been difficult to think of the world that way

766
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,970
and so it makes it harder perhaps to think
of justice in a teleological way,

767
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:21,590
but there is a certain naturalness

768
00:50:22,759 --> 00:50:24,460
to thinking about even the natural world,

769
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:29,030
as teleologically ordered
as a purpose of whole.

770
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:32,930
In fact, children have to be
educated out of this way

771
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:34,590
of looking at the world.

772
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,030
I realized this when my
kids were very young

773
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:43,510
and I was reading them a book,
Winnie the Poo.

774
00:50:45,819 --> 00:50:48,380
And Winnie the Poo gives
you a great idea of how

775
00:50:49,089 --> 00:50:54,600
there is a certain, natural, childlike
way of looking at the world

776
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:59,260
in a teleological way.

777
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,320
You may remember a story

778
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,220
of Winnie-the-Poo walking
in the forest one day,

779
00:51:06,279 --> 00:51:07,620
"He came to a place in the forest,

780
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:12,260
and from the top of the tree
there came a loud buzzing-noise.

781
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,080
Winnie-the-Poo sat at the foot of a tree,
put his head between his paws,

782
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:17,280
and began to think."

783
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:22,240
Here's what he said to himself,
" 'That buzzing-noise means something.

784
00:51:24,299 --> 00:51:27,310
You don't get a buzzing-noise like
that just buzzing and buzzing

785
00:51:27,779 --> 00:51:29,120
without its meaning something.

786
00:51:30,049 --> 00:51:31,540
If there's a buzzing-noise,

787
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:33,580
somebody's making a buzzing-noise.

788
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:37,100
And the only reason for making
a buzzing-noise that I know of,

789
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,540
is because you're a bee.'

790
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:43,800
Then he thought for
another long time and said,

791
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:48,260
'And the only reason for
being a bee that I know of,

792
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:50,540
is making honey.'

793
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:53,700
And then he got up,

794
00:51:55,339 --> 00:51:59,130
and he said, 'And the only
reason for making honey,

795
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:05,260
is so I can eat it.'
So he began to climb the tree."

796
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,480
This is an example
of teleological reasoning.

797
00:52:15,819 --> 00:52:21,520
It isn't so implausible after all.

798
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:27,080
Now, we grew up,
and we're talked out of this way

799
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:28,890
of thinking about the world.

800
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:31,490
But here's the question,

801
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:37,580
even if teleological explanations don't
fit with modern science,

802
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:39,330
even if we've outgrown them

803
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,220
in understanding nature,

804
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:46,360
isn't there
something still intuitively,

805
00:52:46,879 --> 00:52:49,710
and morally plausible,
even powerful,

806
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:54,530
about Aristotle's idea that
the only way to think about justice

807
00:52:56,149 --> 00:53:00,330
is to reason from the purpose,
the goal, the telos,

808
00:53:01,399 --> 00:53:02,240
of the social practice?

809
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:06,080
And isn't that precisely what we were
doing when we were disagreeing about

810
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:07,260
affirmative action?

811
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,490
You can almost recast
that disagreement

812
00:53:11,299 --> 00:53:17,990
as one about what the proper
appropriate purpose, or end

813
00:53:19,009 --> 00:53:21,890
of a university
education consists in.

814
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,980
Reasoning from the purpose
or from the telos.

815
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:28,930
Or from the end.

816
00:53:29,819 --> 00:53:33,770
Aristotle says that's indispensable
to thinking about justice.

817
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:35,450
Is he right?

818
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,720
Think about that question
as you turn to Aristotle's politics.
