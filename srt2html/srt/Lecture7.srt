Last time we began trying to
we began by trying to navigate

4
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,250
our way through Kant's moral theory.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,740
Now, fully to make sense of Kant
moral theory in the groundwork

6
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,840
requires that we be able to answer
three questions.

7
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,860
How can duty and autonomy go together?

8
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,060
What's the great dignity
in answering to duty?

9
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,140
It would seem that these two ideas
are opposed duty and autonomy.

10
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,310
What's Kant's answer to that?

11
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,550
Need someone here to speak up
on Kant's behalf.

12
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,820
Does he have an answer?

13
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,430
Yes, go ahead, stand up.

14
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,470
Kant believes you the only act
autonomously when you are pursuing

15
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,900
something only the name of duty and
not because of your own circumstances

16
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,820
such as 每 like you're only doing
something good and moral

17
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:40,240
if you're doing it because of duty
and not because something

18
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,670
of your own personal gain.

19
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,340
Now why is that acting＃
what's your name?

20
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:44,670
My name is Matt.

21
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,140
Matt, why is that acting on a freedom?
I hear what you're saying about duty?

22
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,210
Because you choose to accept those
moral laws in yourself

23
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,510
and not brought on
from outside upon onto you.

24
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:55,310
Okay, good.
Because acting out of duty 每

25
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,550
Yeah.
- is following a moral law

26
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,710
That you impose on yourself.

27
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,360
That you impose on yourself.
That's what makes duty

28
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:05,520
compatible with freedom.
- Yeah.

29
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,920
Okay, that's good Matt.
That is Kant's answer. That's great.

30
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:17,430
Thank you. So, Kant's answer is
it is not in so far as I am subject

31
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,640
to the law that I have dignity
but rather in so far as with regard

32
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,260
to that very same law,
I'm the author and I am subordinated

33
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:34,340
to that law on that ground that I took
it as much as at I took it upon myself.

34
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,020
I willed that law.
So that's why for Kant acting according

35
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:46,020
to duty and acting freely in the sense
of autonomously are one and the same.

36
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,140
But that raises the question,
how many moral laws are there?

37
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,980
Because if dignity consists and be
governed by a law that I give myself,

38
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,370
what's to guarantee that
my conscience will be

39
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:09,380
the same as your conscience?
Who has Kant's answer to that? Yes?

40
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,670
Because a moral law trend is not
contingent upon seductive conditions.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,020
It would transcend all particular
differences between people

42
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,920
and so would be a universal law
and in this respect there'd only be

43
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:24,720
one moral law
because it would be supreme.

44
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,580
Right. That's exactly right.
What's your name?

45
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,520
Kelly.

46
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,060
Kelly. So Kelly, Kant believes
that if we choose freely

47
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,180
out of our own consciences,
the moral law we're guarantee

48
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,970
to come up with one
and the same moral law. -Yes.

49
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,340
And that's because when I choose
it's not me, Michael Sandel choosing.

50
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:49,850
It's not you, Kelly
choosing for yourself?

51
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,850
What is it exactly?
Who is doing the choosing?

52
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,790
Who's the subject? Who is the agent?
Who is doing the choosing?

53
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,950
Reason? - Well reason＃
Pure reason.

54
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,190
Pure reason and what you mean by
pure reason is what exactly?

55
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,940
Well pure reason is like we were
saying before not subject to any

56
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:16,110
external conditions
that may be imposed on that side.

57
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,100
Good that's' great.
So, the reason that does the willing,

58
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,170
the reason that governs my will
when I will the moral law

59
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,940
is the same reason that operates
when you choose the moral law

60
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:38,320
for yourself and that's why
it's possible to act autonomously

61
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,830
to choose for myself,
for each of us to choose for ourselves

62
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:51,040
as autonomous beings and for all of us
to wind up willing the same moral law,

63
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,780
the categorical imperative.

64
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,860
But then there is one big
and very difficult question left even

65
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,020
if you accept everything that
Matt and Kelly had said so far.

66
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,220
How is a categorical
imperative possible?

67
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,980
How is morality possible?
To answer that question,

68
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,700
Kant said we need to
make a distinction.

69
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,580
We need to make a distinction
between two standpoints,

70
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:32,470
two standpoints from which we can
make sense of our experience.

71
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,340
Let me try to explain what he means
by these two standpoints.

72
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,470
As an object of experience,
I belong to the sensible world.

73
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,430
There my actions are determined
by the laws of nature

74
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,430
and by the regularities
of cause and effect.

75
00:05:53,320 --> 00:06:00,180
But as a subject of experience,
I inhabit an intelligible world here

76
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,620
being independent of the laws of nature
I am capable of autonomy,

77
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:08,700
capable of acting according
to a law I give myself.

78
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,540
Now Kant says that, "Only from this
second standpoint can I regard myself

79
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,620
as free for to be independent
of determination by causes

80
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,590
in the sensible world is to be free."

81
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:33,540
If I were holy and empirical being
as the utilitarian assume,

82
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:43,910
if I were a being holy and only subject
to the deliverances of my senses,

83
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,010
to pain and pleasure and hunger
and thirst and appetite,

84
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,280
if that's all there were to humanity,
we wouldn't be capable of freedom,

85
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:02,220
Kant reasons because in that case
every exercise of will would be

86
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,560
conditioned by the desire
for some object.

87
00:07:07,489 --> 00:07:12,540
In that case all choice would be
heteronomous choice governed

88
00:07:12,739 --> 00:07:19,010
by the pursued of some external end.
"When we think of ourselves as free,"

89
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,340
Kant writes, "we transfer ourselves
into the intelligible world as members

90
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:32,240
and recognize the autonomy of the will."
That's the idea of the two standpoints.

91
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:41,500
So how are categorical imperatives possible?
Only because the idea

92
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,580
of freedom makes me a member
of an intelligible world?

93
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,780
Now Kant admits we aren't
only rational beings.

94
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:58,780
We don't only inhabit the intelligible world,
the realm of freedom.

95
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:05,260
If we did -- if we did,
then all of our actions

96
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:13,660
would invariably accord with the
autonomy of the will.

97
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:20,260
But precisely because we inhabit
simultaneously the two standpoints,

98
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:25,900
the two realms, the realm of freedom
and the realm of necessity

99
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,300
precisely because we inhabit both
realms there is always potentially a gap

100
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:45,270
between what we do and
what we ought to do between is and ought.

101
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,700
Another way of putting this point
and this is the point with which

102
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:53,740
Kant concludes the groundwork,
morality is not empirical.

103
00:08:54,569 --> 00:08:57,940
Whatever you see in the world,
whatever you discover through science

104
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,610
can't decide moral questions.

105
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,080
Morality stands at a certain distance
from the world,

106
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:11,420
from the empirical world.

107
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:16,330
And that's why no science
could deliver moral truth.

108
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:23,420
Now I want to test Kant's moral theory
with the hardest possible case,

109
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,900
a case that he raises,
the case of the murderer at the door.

110
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,740
Kant says that lying is wrong.
We all know that.

111
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,860
We've discussed why. Lying is at
odds with the categorical imperative.

112
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:51,860
A French Philosopher, Benjamin Constant
wrote an article responding

113
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:58,230
to the groundwork where he said,
"This absolute probation online

114
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:06,310
What if a murderer came to your door
looking for your friend

115
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,580
who was hiding in your house?

116
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:15,900
And the murderer asked you point blank,
"Is your friend in your house?"

117
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,370
Constant says, "It would be crazy to
say that the moral thing to do

118
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:24,800
in that case is to tell the truth."

119
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:32,610
Constant says the murderer certainly
doesn't deserve the truth

120
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,010
and Kant wrote to reply.

121
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:44,990
And Kant stuck by his principle
that lying even to the murderer

122
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:47,260
at the door is wrong.

123
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,420
And the reason it's wrong,
he said is once you start taking

124
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:00,830
consequences into account to carve
out exceptions to the categorical

125
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,660
imperative, you've given up
the whole moral framework.

126
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,920
You've become a consequentialist
or maybe a rule utilitarian.

127
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:16,660
But most of you and most to our Kant's
readers think there's something odd

128
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,590
and impossible about this answer.

129
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,400
I would like to try to defend Kant
on this point

130
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:33,220
and then I want to see whether
you think that my defense is plausible,

131
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:40,140
and I would want to defend him within the
spirit of his own account of morality.

132
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,430
Imagine that someone
comes to your door.

133
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,390
You were asked that question
by this murder.

134
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:47,030
You are hiding your friend.

135
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:52,470
Is there a way that you could avoid
telling a lie

136
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:57,880
without selling out your friend?

137
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:03,780
Does anyone have an idea of how
you might be able to do that?

138
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,550
Yes? Stand up.

139
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:10,490
I was just going to say
if I were to let my friend in my house

140
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,990
to hide in the first place,
I'd probably make a plan with them

141
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,310
so I'd be like, "Hey I'll tell the
murderer you're here,

142
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,830
but escape," and that's one
of the options mentioned.

143
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,550
But I'm not sure that's a Kantian option.
You're still lying though.

144
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,470
No because he's in the house
but he won't be.

145
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:37,980
Oh I see. All right, good enough.
One more try.

146
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:42,200
If you just say you don't know
where he is because he might not

147
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:43,540
be locked in the closet.

148
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,770
He might have left the closet.
You have no clue where he could be.

149
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,290
So you would say, I don't know
which wouldn't actually be a lie

150
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:58,040
because you weren't at that
very moment looking in the closet.

151
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,460
Exactly.
-So it would be strictly speaking true.

152
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,400
Yes.

153
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:13,060
And yet possibly deceiving, misleading.
-But still true.

154
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:17,630
What's your name?
-John.

155
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:22,570
John. All right, John has...
now John may be on to something.

156
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:27,860
John you're really offering us the option
of a clever evasion

157
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:29,900
that is strictly speaking true.

158
00:13:31,469 --> 00:13:37,590
This raises the question whether there is
a moral difference between

159
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:43,020
an outright lie and a misleading truth.

160
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:53,660
From Kant's point of view there actually
is a world of difference between a lie

161
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,780
and a misleading truth.

162
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,210
Why is that even though both might
have the same consequences?

163
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,090
But then remember Kant doesn't base
morality on consequences.

164
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:14,340
He bases it on formal adherence
to the moral law.

165
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:21,890
Now, sometimes in ordinary life we make
exceptions for the general rule against

166
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:25,360
lying with the white lie.
What is a white lie?

167
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,010
It's a lie to make...you're well to avoid
hurting someone's feelings for example.

168
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,780
It's a lie that we think of as justified
by the consequences.

169
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:40,390
Now Kant could not endorse a white lie
but perhaps he could endorse

170
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,620
a misleading truth.

171
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:48,770
Supposed someone gives you a tie,
as a gift, and you open the box

172
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:55,140
and it's just awful.
What do you say? Thank you.

173
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:57,310
You could say thank you.

174
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,630
But they're waiting to see what you think
of it or they ask you

175
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,070
what do you think of it?

176
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:04,730
You could tell a white lie
and say it's beautiful.

177
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,760
But that wouldn't be permissible
from Kant's point of view.

178
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,000
Could you say not a white lie
but a misleading truth,

179
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:22,050
you open the box and you say,
"I've never seen a tie like that before.

180
00:15:23,849 --> 00:15:28,630
Thank you."
You shouldn't have.

181
00:15:30,219 --> 00:15:31,140
That's good.

182
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:45,350
Can you think of a contemporary
political leader who engaged...you can?

183
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,550
Who are you thinking of?

184
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:54,760
You remember the whole
carefully worded denials in the

185
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:58,100
Monica Lewinsky affair
of Bill Clinton.

186
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:07,110
Now, those denials actually became
the subject of very explicit debate

187
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,540
in argument during the
impeachment hearings.

188
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,190
Take a look at the following excerpts
from Bill Clinton.

189
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:24,370
Is there something do you think morally
at stake in the distinction between a lie

190
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:30,150
and a misleading carefully
couched truth?

191
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,140
I want to say one thing
to the American people.

192
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,380
I want you to listen to me.
I'm going to say this again.

193
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:45,250
I did not have sexual relations
with that woman Miss Lewinsky.

194
00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:53,060
I never told anybody to lie not a single
time, never. These allegations are false.

195
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,570
Did he lie to the American people when he
said I never had sex with that woman?

196
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,500
You know, he doesn't believe he did
and because of the ＃

197
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,220
Well he didn't explain it.

198
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,660
He did explain that, explain congressman.

199
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:12,490
What he said was to the American people
that he did not have sexual relations

200
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,580
and I understand you're not going to
like this congressman

201
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:19,810
because you will see it as a
hair-splitting evasive answer.

202
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,050
But in his own mind his definition was not...

203
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,950
Okay, I understand that argument.
-Okay.

204
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,940
All right, so there you have the exchange.

205
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,900
Now at the time,
you may have thought this was just a

206
00:17:36,129 --> 00:17:40,210
legalistic hair-splitting exchange between
a Republican who wanted to

207
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:43,430
impeach Clinton and a lawyer who is
trying to defend him.

208
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:50,780
But now in the light of Kant,
do you think there is something

209
00:17:51,840 --> 00:18:00,740
morally at stake in the distinction between
a lie and an evasion,

210
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,940
a true but misleading statement?
I'd like to hear from defenders of Kant.

211
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:12,380
People who think there is a distinction.
Are you ready to defend Kant?

212
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,420
Well I think when you try to say that lying
and misleading truths are the same thing;

213
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:21,620
you're basing it on consequentialist argument
which is that they achieve the same thing.

214
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,100
But the fact to the fact to the matter is
you told the truth

215
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,710
and you intended that people would
believe what you are saying

216
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,420
which was the truth
which means it is not morally the same

217
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,680
as telling a lie and intending that they
believe it is the truth

218
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:34,390
even though it is not true.

219
00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:36,190
Good. What's your name?
-Diana.

220
00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:42,780
So Diana says that Kant has a point here
and it's a point that might even come

221
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,540
to the aid of Bill Clinton and that is ＃
well what about that?

222
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:52,310
There's someone over here.

223
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:55,940
For Kant motivation is key,
so if you give to someone

224
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:58,420
because primarily you want
to feel good about yourself

225
00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:02,060
Kant would say that has no moral worth.
Well with this, the motivation is the same.

226
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,220
It's to sort of mislead someone,
it's to lie, it's to sort of throw them

227
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,610
off the track and the motivation is the same.
So there should be no difference.

228
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,710
Okay, good. So here isn't the
motive the same Diana?

229
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:18,220
What do you say to this argument that
well the motive is the same in both cases

230
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,620
there is the attempt or at least the hope
that one's pursuer will be misled?

231
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,910
Well that 每 you could look it that way
but I think that the fact is

232
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:31,780
that your immediate motive is that
they should believe you.

233
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,020
The ultimate consequence of that is t
hat they might be deceived

234
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,350
and not find out what was going on.

235
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,750
But that your immediate motive is that
they should believe you

236
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,190
because you're telling the truth.

237
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,960
May I help a little?
-Sure.

238
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:47,550
You and Kant. Why don't you say...
and what's your name, I'm sorry?

239
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:48,500
Wesley.

240
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,540
Why don't you say to Wesley
it's not exactly the case

241
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:59,920
that the motive in both cases
is to mislead?

242
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,190
They're hoping, they're hoping that
the person will be misled

243
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:14,100
by the statement "I don't know where they
are" or "I never had sexual relations."

244
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,470
You're hoping that they will be misled
but in the case

245
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:22,270
where you're telling the truth,
you're motive is to mislead

246
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,320
while at the same time telling the truth
and honoring the moral law

247
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:29,380
and staying within the bounds
of the categorical imperative.

248
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,430
I think Kant's answer would be Diana, yes?
-Yes.

249
00:20:33,639 --> 00:20:34,940
You like that?
-I do.

250
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:40,340
Okay. So I think Kant's answer
would be unlike a falsehood,

251
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:46,340
unlike a lie, a misleading truth
pays a certain homage to duty.

252
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,600
And the homage it pays to duty
is what justifies that the work of

253
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:58,220
even the work of the evasion.
Diana, yes you like? Okay.

254
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:08,180
And so there is something,
some element of respect for the dignity

255
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:15,860
of the moral law in the careful evasion
because Clinton could have told an

256
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,140
outright lie but he didn't.

257
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:28,220
And so I think Kant's insight here is in the
carefully couched but true evasion.

258
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,540
There is a kind of homage to the dignity
of the moral law that is not present

259
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,540
in the outright lie and that, Wesley,
is part of the motive.

260
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,380
It's part of the motive.
Yes, I hope he will be misled.

261
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,400
I hope the murderer will run down
the road or go to the mall looking

262
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,220
for my friend instead at the closet.
I hope that will be the effect.

263
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,430
I can't control that.
I can't control the consequences.

264
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:03,100
But what I can control is standing by
and honoring however I pursue the ends,

265
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:11,650
I hope will unfold to do so in a way that is
consistent with respect for the moral law.

266
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,540
Wesley, I don't think, is entirely
persuaded but at least this brings out,

267
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,260
this discussion brings out
some of what it's at stake,

268
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,460
what's morally at stake in Kant's notion
of the categorical imperative.

269
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:37,780
As long as any effort this involved
I would say that the contract is valid then.

270
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:40,300
It should take effect.

271
00:22:40,879 --> 00:22:43,540
But why? What was...
what morally can you point to?

272
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:47,820
For example two people agreed
to be married and one suddenly

273
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,420
called the other in two minutes say
I changed my mind.

274
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:53,760
Does the contract have obligation
on both sides?

275
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,500
Well I am tempted to say no.

276
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,650
Fine.

277
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,020
Last time we talked about Kant's
categorical imperative

278
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,500
and we considered the way he applied the idea
of the categorical imperative

279
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,860
to the case of lying.

280
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:27,420
I want to turn briefly to one other application
of Kant's moral theory

281
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,820
and that's his political theory.

282
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:38,420
Now Kant says that just laws arise from
a certain kind of social contract.

283
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,660
But this contract he tells us is
of an exceptional nature.

284
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:53,020
What makes the contract exceptional
is that it is not an actual contract

285
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:59,140
that happens when people come together
and try to figure out

286
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,180
what the constitution should be.

287
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:10,420
Kant points out that the contract
that generates justice

288
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,590
is what he calls an idea of reason.

289
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,140
It's not an actual contract among
actual men and women gathered

290
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,940
in a constitutional convention.
Why not?

291
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:28,220
I think Kant's reason is that
actual men and women gathered in real

292
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:33,230
constitutional convention would have
different interests, values, aims,

293
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,310
and it would also be differences
of bargaining power

294
00:24:36,939 --> 00:24:39,770
and differences of knowledge
among them.

295
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:45,060
And so the laws that would result from
their deliberations wouldn't necessarily

296
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:50,060
be just, wouldn't necessarily conform
to principles of right

297
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,700
but would simply reflect the differences
a bargaining power,

298
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,380
the special interests the fact that some
might know more than others

299
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,300
about law or about politics.

300
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:13,740
So Kant says, "A contract that generates
principles of right is merely an idea

301
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,540
of reason but it has undoubted
practical reality because it can oblige

302
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,980
every legislator to frame his laws
in such a way that they could have been

303
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,100
produced by the united will
of the whole nation."

304
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:34,140
So Kant is a contractarian,
but he doesn't trace the origin

305
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,630
or the rightness of law to any
actual social contract.

306
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,300
This contrives to an obvious question.

307
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:51,060
What is the moral force
of a hypothetical contract,

308
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,220
a contract that never happened?

309
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:58,580
That's the question we take up today
but in order to investigate it,

310
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:06,380
we need to turn to a modern philosopher,
John Rawls, who worked out in his book,

311
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:12,820
A Theory of Justice, in great detail
and account of a hypothetical agreement

312
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,180
as the basis for justice.

313
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:22,460
Rawls' theory of justice in broad outline
is parallel to Kant's

314
00:26:22,889 --> 00:26:24,700
in two important respects.

315
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,830
Like Kant, Rawls was a critic
of utilitarianism.

316
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:38,150
"Each person possesses an
inviolability founded on justice,"

317
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:42,700
Rawls' writes, "that even the welfare
of society as a whole cannot override.

318
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,380
The rights secured by justice are not
subject to political bargaining

319
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:50,660
or to the calculus social interests."

320
00:26:52,800 --> 00:27:03,620
The second respect in which Rawls' theory
follows Kant's is on the idea that

321
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:11,580
principles of justice properly understood
can be derived from a hypothetical

322
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,740
social contract.
Not an actual one.

323
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:23,740
And Rawls works this out in
fascinating detail with the device

324
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,940
of what he calls the "veil of ignorance".

325
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:37,340
The way to arrive at the rights...
the basic rights that we must respect,

326
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:46,850
the basic framework of rights and duties
is to imagine that we were

327
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:52,140
gathered together trying to choose the
principles to govern our collective lives

328
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:01,620
without knowing certain important
particular fact about ourselves.

329
00:28:02,649 --> 00:28:04,620
That's the idea of the veil of ignorance.

330
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,260
Now what would happen if we gather
together just as we are here

331
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,580
and try to come up with principles
of justice to govern our collective life?

332
00:28:16,439 --> 00:28:21,460
There would be a cacophony of proposals
of suggestions reflecting people's

333
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,900
different interests, some are strong,
some are weak,

334
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,700
some are rich, some are poor.

335
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,680
So Rawls says, imagine instead that we
are gathered in an original position

336
00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:44,700
of equality and what assures the equality
is the veil of ignorance.

337
00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:53,020
Imagine that we are all behind a veil
of ignorance which temporarily abstracts

338
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:59,900
from or brackets, hides from us
who in particular we are.

339
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,980
Our race, our class, our place in society,
our strengths, our weaknesses,

340
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:14,220
whether we're healthy or unhealthy,
then and only then Rawls says,

341
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:18,500
the principles we would agree to
would be principles of justice.

342
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:22,700
That's how the hypothetical
contract works.

343
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,540
What is the moral force of this kind
of hypothetical agreement?

344
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,860
Is it stronger or weaker than a real
agreement, an actual social contract?

345
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:50,100
In order to answer that question,
we have to look hard at the moral force

346
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:56,900
of actual contracts.
There are really two questions here.

347
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:04,300
One of them is how do actual contracts
bind me or obligate me?

348
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,020
Question number one.

349
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:11,300
And question number two,
how do actual real life contracts

350
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:13,660
justify the terms that they produce?

351
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:20,380
If you think about it
and this is in line with Rawls and Kant,

352
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:25,740
the answer to the second question,
how do actual contracts justify

353
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,620
the terms that they produce,
the answer is they don't.

354
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:32,140
At least not on their own.

355
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,180
Actual contracts are not self-sufficient
moral instruments

356
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:41,300
of any actual contract or agreement.

357
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,340
It can always be asked,
is it fair what they agreed to?

358
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,220
The fact of the agreement never guarantees
the fairness of the agreement

359
00:30:55,639 --> 00:30:59,500
and we know this by looking at
our own constitutional convention.

360
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:06,480
It produced a constitution that
permitted slavery to persist.

361
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,900
It was agreed to.
It was an actual contract

362
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:17,100
but that doesn't establish that the
laws agreed to all of them were just.

363
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,930
Well then what is the moral force
of actual contracts?

364
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:28,900
To the extent that they bind us,
they obligate in two ways.

365
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:34,100
Suppose, maybe here it would help
to take an example.

366
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,620
We make an agreement,
a commercial agreement.

367
00:31:42,939 --> 00:31:49,300
I promise to pay you $100
if you will go harvest

368
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,270
and bring to me 100 lobsters.
We make a deal.

369
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,940
You go out and harvest them
and bring them to me.

370
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,660
I eat the lobsters, served them to my
friends, and then I don't pay.

371
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,160
And you say, "But you're obligated."

372
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:12,100
And I say, "Why?"
What do you say? "Well we had a deal."

373
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,060
And you benefited.
You ate all those lobsters.

374
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,580
Well that's a pretty strong argument.

375
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:34,540
It's an argument that depends though
and the fact that I benefited from your labor

376
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:46,630
So, contracts sometimes bind us in so far as
they are instruments of mutual benefit.

377
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:50,740
I ate the lobsters. I owe you the $100
for having gathered them.

378
00:32:53,719 --> 00:32:56,660
But suppose, now take a second case.
We make this deal,

379
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,020
I'll pay you $100 for
100 lobsters and two minutes later,

380
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,820
before you've gone to any work
I call you back and say

381
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:12,020
I've changed my mind.
Now, there's no benefit.

382
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:19,700
There's no work on your part so there's no
element of reciprocal exchange.

383
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,620
What about in that case,
do I still owe you merely in virtue

384
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,620
of the fact that we had an agreement?

385
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:34,700
Who says those of you who say, yes,
I still owe you? Why? Okay, stand up.

386
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,540
Why do I owe you?
I called you back after two minutes.

387
00:33:38,879 --> 00:33:40,220
You haven't done any work.

388
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:45,540
I think I spent the time and effort
in drafting this contract with you

389
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:49,260
and also have emotional expectation
that I go through the work.

390
00:33:50,439 --> 00:33:53,260
So you took time to draft the contract
but we did it very quickly.

391
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,920
We just chatted on the phone.

392
00:33:56,639 --> 00:33:59,060
That wouldn't be a formal form
of contract though.

393
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:01,260
Well I faxed at you.
It only took a minute.

394
00:34:03,639 --> 00:34:09,580
As long as any effort is involved,
I would say that the contract is valid then.

395
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:11,900
It should take effect.

396
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,700
But why? What was...what morally
can you point to that obligates me?

397
00:34:19,339 --> 00:34:25,660
I admit that I agreed but you didn't go
to any work. I didn't enjoy any benefit.

398
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,380
Because one might mentally go through
all the work of harvesting the lobsters.

399
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,100
You mentally went through the work
of harvesting the lobsters.

400
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,960
That's nothing is it?
It's not much.

401
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,460
Is it worth $100 that you were imagining
yourself going and collecting lobsters?

402
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,580
It may not worth $100,
but it may worth something to some people.

403
00:34:48,799 --> 00:34:54,220
All right, I'll give you a buck for that.
But what I 每 so you're still pointing...

404
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:59,300
what's interesting you're still pointing
to the reciprocal dimension of contracts.

405
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,020
You did or imagined that you did or looked
forward to doing something that might be had.

406
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,900
For example two people agreed to be married
and one suddenly calls the other

407
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,500
in two minutes say,
I've changed my mind,

408
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,420
does the contract have obligation
on both sides?

409
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,980
Nobody has done any work
or nobody has benefited yet.

410
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,780
Well I'm tempted to say no.

411
00:35:29,279 --> 00:35:29,940
Fine.

412
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,540
All, right. What's your name?
-Julian.

413
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,620
Thank you Julian.
All right, that was good.

414
00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:48,380
Now is there anyone who has who agrees
with Julian that I still owe the money?

415
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,240
For any other reason now I have ＃
go ahead, stand up.

416
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:58,740
I think if you back out it sort of
cheapens the institution of contracts.

417
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,340
Good but why? Why does it?

418
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:06,740
Well I think is kind of Kantian, but there's
in almost there's a certain intrinsic value

419
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,380
in being able to make contracts
and having, you know, knowing

420
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,640
people will expect that
you'll go through with that.

421
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:17,260
Good, there is some...
it would cheapen the whole idea

422
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:23,460
of contracts which has to do with taking
in obligation on myself. Is that the idea?

423
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:25,300
Yeah, I think so.

424
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,500
What's your name?
-Adam.

425
00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:33,780
So Adam points instead not to any
reciprocal benefit or mutual exchange

426
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,350
but to the mere fact
of the agreement itself.

427
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:41,270
We see here there are really
two different ways in which

428
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,060
actual contracts generate obligations.

429
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:52,340
One has to do with the active consent
as a voluntary act and it points...

430
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:56,780
Adam said this was a Kantian idea
and I think he is right

431
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,470
because it points to the ideal
of autonomy.

432
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,260
When I make a contract,
the obligation is one that is self-imposed

433
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:11,060
and that carries a certain moral weight,
independent of other considerations.

434
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,780
And then there's a second element
of the moral force of contract arguments

435
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,140
which has to do with the sense
in which actual contracts are instruments

436
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:29,120
of mutual benefit and this points
toward the ideal of reciprocity

437
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,260
that obligation can arise,
I can have an obligation to you in so far

438
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,020
as you do something for me.

439
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:51,460
Now, when investigating the moral force and
also the moral limits of actual contracts

440
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:58,740
and here I would like to advance
an argument about the moral limits

441
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:07,050
of actual contracts now that we know
what moral ingredients do the work

442
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,740
when people come together and say,
"I will do this if you do that."

443
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,500
I would like to argue first that the fact
that two people agreed

444
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:23,300
to some exchange does not mean
that the terms of their agreement are fair.

445
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,700
When my two sons were young they
collected baseball cards and traded them.

446
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:38,980
And one was...there was a two-year aged...
there is a two-year aged difference

447
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:48,420
between them and so I had to institute a rule
about the trades that no trade was complete

448
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:54,740
until I had approved it
and the reason is obvious.

449
00:38:56,049 --> 00:39:00,660
The older one knew more about
the value of these cards

450
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,810
and so would take advantage
of the younger one.

451
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:11,630
So that's why I had to review it to make sure
that the agreements were fair.

452
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:14,300
Now you may say,
"Well this is paternalism."

453
00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:22,940
Of course it was. That's what paternalism
is for that kind of thing.

454
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,340
So what does this show?

455
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,340
What is the baseball cards example show?

456
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:35,420
The fact of an agreement is not sufficient
to establish the fairness of the terms.

457
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:42,060
I read some years ago of a case in
Chicago there was an elderly widow,

458
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:48,340
an 84-year-old widow named Rose
who had a problem in her apartment

459
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:56,740
with a leaky toilet and she signed a contract
with an unscrupulous contractor,

460
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,940
who offered to repair her leaky toilet
in exchange for $50,000.

461
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,540
But she had agreed
she was of sound mind,

462
00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:13,220
maybe terribly naive and unfamiliar
with the price of plumbing,

463
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,860
she had made this agreement.

464
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,140
Luckily, it was discovered.

465
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,340
She went to the bank
and asked to withdraw $25,000.

466
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,060
And the teller said, "Why do you need all
of that money for?"

467
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,540
And she said,
"Well, I have a leaky toilet."

468
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,910
And the teller called authorities and they
discovered this unscrupulous contractor.

469
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:47,420
Now, I suspect that even the most ardent
contract carryings in the room will agree

470
00:40:49,529 --> 00:40:55,940
that the fact of this woman's agreement
is not a sufficient condition

471
00:40:57,339 --> 00:40:58,680
of the agreement being fair.

472
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:09,020
Is there anyone who will dispute that?
No one. Am I missing anyone?

473
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:12,420
Alex, where are you?

474
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,580
Where are you?

475
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:23,490
So, maybe there's no dispute then
to my first claim that an actual agreement

476
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,140
is not necessary to their..
is not a sufficient condition

477
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,340
of there being an obligation.

478
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:37,340
I want to now make us stronger,
maybe more controversial claim about

479
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:48,140
the moral limits of actual contracts
that a contract or an active consent is

480
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:53,660
not only not sufficient
but it's not even a necessary condition

481
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,540
of there being an obligation.

482
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,620
And the idea here is that
if there is reciprocity,

483
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,660
if there is an exchange,
then a receipt of benefits,

484
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,220
there can be an obligation
even without an act of consent.

485
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:18,460
One great example of this involves
the 18th century philosopher,

486
00:42:18,799 --> 00:42:20,700
the Scottish moral philosopher
David Hume.

487
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,460
When he was young,
Hume wrote a book arguing against

488
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,780
Locke's idea of an original
social contract.

489
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,060
Hume heaps scorn on his
contractarian idea.

490
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,220
He said it was a philosophical fiction.

491
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:41,020
One of the most mysterious
and incomprehensible operations

492
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,340
that can possibly be imagined this
idea of the social contract.

493
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,540
Many years later when he was 62 years old,
Hume had an experience

494
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,540
that put to the test his rejection
of consent us the basis of obligation.

495
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,420
Hume had a house in Edinboro.

496
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,260
He rented to his friend James Boswell
who in turn sublet it to a subtenant.

497
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:08,840
The subtenant decided that the house
needed some repairs and a paint job.

498
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,510
He hired a contractor to do the work.

499
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,260
The painter did the work
and sent the bill to Hume.

500
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,900
Hume refused to pay on the grounds
that he hadn't consented.

501
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,980
He hadn't hired the painter.
The case went to court.

502
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,300
The contractor said,
"It's true, Hume didn't agree

503
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,940
but the house needed the painting
and I gave it a very good one."

504
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:36,260
Hume thought this was a bad argument.

505
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,740
The only argument this painter makes
is that the work was necessary to be done

506
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,700
but this is no good answer
because by the same rule,

507
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,060
this painter may go through every house
in Edinboro and do what he thinks proper

508
00:43:49,279 --> 00:43:53,140
to be done without the landlord's consent
and give the same reason

509
00:43:53,759 --> 00:43:57,660
that the work was necessary
and that the house was the better for it.

510
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,960
So Hume didn't like the theory that there
could be obligation to repay a benefit

511
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:10,550
without consent. But the defense failed
and he had to pay.

512
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,060
Let met give you one other example
of the distinction

513
00:44:15,279 --> 00:44:20,700
between the consent-based aspect
of obligations and the benefit-based aspect

514
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,460
and how they're sometimes run together.

515
00:44:24,569 --> 00:44:27,380
This is based on a personal experience.

516
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,180
Some years ago,
I was driving across the country

517
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,380
with some friends and we found ourselves
in the middle of nowhere

518
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:36,780
in Hammond, Indiana.

519
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,140
We stopped in a rest stop
and got out of the car

520
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:43,620
and when we came back
our car wouldn't start.

521
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:46,940
None of us knew much about cars.

522
00:44:48,339 --> 00:44:52,820
We didn't really know what to do
until we noticed that in the parking lot

523
00:44:53,279 --> 00:44:57,670
driving up next to us was a van
and on the side it said,

524
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:03,660
"Sam's mobile repair van."
And out of the van came a man,

525
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,780
presumably Sam and he came up to us
and he said, "Can I help you?

526
00:45:10,799 --> 00:45:14,260
Here's how I work.
I work by the hour for $50 an hour.

527
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,620
If I fix your car in five minutes,
you owe me the $50

528
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,460
and if I work on your car for an hour
and can't fix it,

529
00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:23,420
you'll still owe me the $50."

530
00:45:24,779 --> 00:45:27,500
So I said, "But what is the likelihood
that you'll be able to fix the car"

531
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,980
and he didn't answer.

532
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:35,460
But he did start looking under the poking
around the steering column.

533
00:45:37,009 --> 00:45:40,750
Short time passed, he emerged from under
the steering column and said,

534
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,060
"There's nothing wrong with the
ignition system

535
00:45:43,279 --> 00:45:46,620
but you still have 45 minutes left.
Should I look under the hood?"

536
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,300
I said, "Wait a minute. I haven't hired you.
We haven't made any agreement."

537
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,300
And then he became very angry and he said,
"Do you mean to say that

538
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,300
if I had fixed your car while I was working
under the steering column

539
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,980
that you wouldn't have paid me?"
And I said, "That's a different question."

540
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,220
I didn't go into the distinction between
consent based and benefit based applications.

541
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,980
But I think he had the intuition
that if he had fixed it

542
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,700
while he was poking around
that I would have owed him the $50.

543
00:46:36,879 --> 00:46:41,620
I shared that intuition. I would have.
But he inferred from that.

544
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:47,420
This was the fallacy and the reasoning
that I think lay behind his anger.

545
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:54,540
He inferred from that fact that therefore
implicitly we had an agreement.

546
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,260
But that it seems to me as a mistake.

547
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,620
It's a mistake that fails to recognize
the distinction between

548
00:47:02,009 --> 00:47:05,020
these two different aspects
of contract arguments.

549
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:10,060
Yes, I agree. I would have owed him $50
if he had repaired my car during that time

550
00:47:10,279 --> 00:47:14,500
not because we had made any agreement.
We hadn't.

551
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,190
But simply because if he had fixed my car,
he would have conferred on me a benefit

552
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:25,380
for which I would have owed him in the
name of reciprocity and fairness.

553
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,220
So here's another example of the
distinction between these two different

554
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,500
kinds of arguments, these two different
aspects of the morality of contract.

555
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:40,300
Now I want to hear how many think I was
in the right in that case?

556
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,220
That's reassuring. Is there anyone who
thinks I was in the wrong?

557
00:47:51,279 --> 00:47:58,420
Anyone? You do?
Why? Go ahead.

558
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,320
Isn't the problem with this is that any
benefit is inherently subjectively defined?

559
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,300
I mean what if you wanted your car
broken and he had fixed it? I mean...

560
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,700
No, I didn't want it broken.

561
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,780
Yeah in this case. I mean...

562
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,740
But who would?
Who would?

563
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,340
I don't know, someone.

564
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,860
I mean what if Hume,
you know, what if the painter

565
00:48:20,089 --> 00:48:23,340
that painted his house blue
but he hated the color blue,

566
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:29,620
I mean you have to sort of define what
your benefit is before the person does it.

567
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,620
Well all right, so what would you
conclude for that though

568
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,740
for the larger issue here,
would you conclude that

569
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,380
therefore consent is a necessary condition
of their being an obligation?

570
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,020
Absolutely.
-You would. What's your name?

571
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,140
Nate.

572
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,700
Because otherwise how can we know,
Nate says, whether there has been

573
00:48:51,879 --> 00:48:58,740
an exchange of equivalent or fair benefits
unless we have the subjective evaluation

574
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,630
which may vary one person
to the next of the situation.

575
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:03,660
All right, that's a fair challenge.

576
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:10,580
Let me put to you one other example
in order to test the relation between

577
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,280
these two aspects
of the morality of contract.

578
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:19,580
Suppose I get married and suppose
I discover that after 20 years

579
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:24,950
of faithfulness on my part,
every year on our trip across the country

580
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:31,620
my wife has been seeing another man,
a man with a van on the Indiana toll road.

581
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,620
This part is completely made up
by the way.

582
00:49:37,879 --> 00:49:41,330
Wouldn't I have two different reasons
for moral outrage?

583
00:49:43,759 --> 00:49:45,700
One reason could be
we had an agreement.

584
00:49:46,279 --> 00:49:50,260
She broke her promise referring
to the fact of her consent.

585
00:49:51,799 --> 00:49:56,580
But I would also have a second ground
for moral outrage having nothing to do

586
00:49:56,799 --> 00:50:00,580
with the contract as such
but I've been so faithful for my part.

587
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:03,340
Surely I deserve better than this.

588
00:50:04,279 --> 00:50:06,180
Is this what I'm doing in return
and so on?

589
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:08,580
So that would point
to the element of reciprocity.

590
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:14,340
Each reason has an
independent moral force.

591
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:18,140
That's the general point
and you can see this if you imagine

592
00:50:18,529 --> 00:50:21,090
a slight variation on the marriage case.

593
00:50:22,359 --> 00:50:25,100
Suppose we haven't been married
for 20 years.

594
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,180
Suppose we were just married
and that the betrayal occurred

595
00:50:30,759 --> 00:50:33,660
on the way to our honeymoon
in Hammond, Indiana.

596
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:39,500
After the contract has been made,
but before there is any history

597
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:46,820
of performance on my part,
performance of the contract I mean,

598
00:50:53,160 --> 00:51:01,380
I would still with Julian,
I'd be able to say

599
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,780
but you promised, you promised.

600
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,900
That would isolate the pure element
of consent,

601
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:13,180
right where there were no benefits,
never mind. You get the idea.

602
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:28,580
Here's the main idea,
actual contracts have their moral force

603
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:35,220
in virtue of two distinguishable ideals:
autonomy and reciprocity,

604
00:51:37,569 --> 00:51:46,610
but in real life every actual contract
may fall short, may fail to realize

605
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:52,020
the ideals that give contracts
their moral force in the first place.

606
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:58,560
The ideal of autonomy may not be
realized because there may be

607
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,840
a difference in the bargaining power
of the parties.

608
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:10,100
The ideal of reciprocity may not
be realized because there may be

609
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:15,660
a difference of knowledge between the
parties and so they may misidentify

610
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:21,780
what really counts
as having equivalent value.

611
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:31,340
Now suppose you were to
imagine a contract where the ideals

612
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,620
of autonomy and of reciprocity were not
subject to contingency

613
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:41,980
but were guaranteed to be realized,
what kind of contract would that have to be?

614
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:47,900
Imagine a contract among parties
who were equal in power and knowledge

615
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:53,780
rather than unequal who are identically
situated rather than differently situated?

616
00:52:55,560 --> 00:53:03,220
That is the idea behind Rawls' claim
that the way to think about justice

617
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,940
is from the standpoint
of a hypothetical contract,

618
00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:14,500
behind a veil of ignorance that creates
the condition of equality by ruling out

619
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:20,060
or enabling us to forget for the moment
the differences in power and knowledge

620
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:26,460
that could even in principle
lead to unfair results.

621
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:34,860
This is why for Kant and for Rawls
a hypothetical contract among equals

622
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:39,700
is the only way to think about
principles of justice.

623
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,140
What will those principles be?
That's the question we'll turn to next time.
