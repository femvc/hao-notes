Today, we turn to John Locke.

4
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,770
On the face of it, Locke is a powerful
ally of the libertarian.

5
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:53,630
First, he believes,
as libertarians today maintain,

6
00:00:55,169 --> 00:01:01,520
that there are certain fundamental
individual rights that are so important

7
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,750
that no government,
even a representative government,

8
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,170
even a democratically elected government,
can override them.

9
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:18,560
Not only that, he believes that
those fundamental rights include

10
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,420
a natural right to life,
liberty, and property,

11
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:35,030
and furthermore he argues
that the right to property

12
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,330
is not just the creation
of government or of law.

13
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,110
The right to property is
a natural right in the sense

14
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,420
that it is prepolitical.

15
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:59,340
It is a right that attaches
to individuals as human beings,

16
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:02,440
even before government
comes on the scene,

17
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,000
even before parliaments
and legislatures

18
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,460
enact laws to define rights
and to enforce them.

19
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:15,530
Locke says in order to think about
what it means to have a natural right,

20
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,530
we have to imagine
the way things are

21
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:28,000
before government, before law,
and that's what Locke means

22
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,240
by the state of nature.

23
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:34,860
He says the state of nature
is a state of liberty.

24
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:42,510
Human beings are
free and equal beings.

25
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:45,810
There is no natural hierarchy.

26
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:49,750
It's not the case that some people
are born to be kings

27
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,860
and others are born
to be serfs.

28
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,540
We are free and equal
in the state of nature and yet,

29
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:02,700
he makes the point that
there is a difference between

30
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,940
a state of liberty and
a state of license.

31
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,260
And the reason is that even
in the state of nature,

32
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,610
there is a kind of law.

33
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,180
It's not the kind of law
that legislatures enact.

34
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:23,160
It's a law of nature.
And this law of nature constrains

35
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,920
what we can do even though
we are free,

36
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,120
even though we are
in the state of nature.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,800
Well what are the constraints?

38
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,970
The only constraint given
by the law of nature

39
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,210
is that the rights we have,
the natural rights we have

40
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,280
we can't give up
nor can we take them

41
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,650
from somebody else.

42
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,490
Under the law of nature,
I'm not free to take somebody else's

43
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:06,260
life or liberty or property,
nor am I free to take

44
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:11,480
my own life or liberty or property.

45
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:17,150
Even though I am free,
I'm not free to violate the law of nature.

46
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,410
I'm not free to take my own life
or to sell my self into slavery

47
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:28,620
or to give to somebody else
arbitrary absolute power over me.

48
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,200
So where does this constraint,
you may think it's a fairly

49
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,020
minimal constraint,
but where does it come from?

50
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,250
Well, Locke tells us
where it comes from

51
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:45,300
and he gives two answers.
Here is the first answer.

52
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:53,040
"For men, being all the workmanship
of one omnipotent,

53
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,970
and infinitely wise maker,"
namely God,

54
00:04:57,349 --> 00:05:00,360
"they are His property,
whose workmanship they are,

55
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,900
made to last during His,
not one another's pleasure."

56
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,100
So one answer to the question
is why can't I give up

57
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,500
my natural rights to life, liberty,
and property is well,

58
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,840
they're not, strictly speaking,
yours.

59
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:28,140
After all, you are the creature of God.
God has a bigger property right in us,

60
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,800
a prior property right.

61
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,420
Now, you might say
that's an unsatisfying,

62
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,020
unconvincing answer,
at least for those

63
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,260
who don't believe in God.

64
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,150
What did Locke have to say to them?
Well, here is where Locke appeals

65
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:48,580
to the idea of reason
and this is the idea,

66
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,510
that if we properly reflect
on what it means to be free,

67
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,690
we will be led to the conclusion
that freedom can't just be a matter

68
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:02,140
of doing whatever we want.

69
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:07,390
I think this is what Locke means
when he says, "The state of nature

70
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,170
has a law of nature to govern it
which obliges everyone: and reason,

71
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,560
which is that law, teaches mankind
who will but consult it

72
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,210
that all being equal and independent,
no one ought to harm another

73
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,030
in his life, health,
liberty, or possessions."

74
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,840
This leads to a puzzling
paradoxical feature of Locke's

75
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,420
account of rights.

Familiar in one sense
but strange in another.

76
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,560
It's the idea that our natural rights
are unalienable.

77
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,540
What does "unalienable" mean?
It's not for us to alienate them

78
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,260
or to give them up, to give them away,
to trade them away, to sell them.

79
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,610
Consider an airline ticket.
Airline tickets are nontransferable.

80
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,130
Or tickets to the Patriots
or to the Red Sox.

81
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,330
Nontransferable tickets
are unalienable.

82
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,020
I own them in the limited sense
that I can use them for myself,

83
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,850
but I can't trade them away.
So in one sense, an unalienable right,

84
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:23,850
a nontransferable right makes
something I own less fully mine.

85
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:30,420
But in another sense
of unalienable rights,

86
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,820
especially where we're thinking
about life, liberty, and property,

87
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:40,620
or a right to be unalienable
makes it more deeply,

88
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,570
more profoundly mine,
and that's Locke's sense

89
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,440
of unalienable.

90
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,370
We see it in the American Declaration
of Independence.

91
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,710
Thomas Jefferson drew
on this idea of Locke.

92
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,790
Unalienable rights to life, liberty,
and as Jefferson amended Locke,

93
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,550
to the pursuit of happiness.
Unalienable rights.

94
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:13,350
Rights that are so essentially mine
that even I can't trade them away

95
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,200
or give them up.

96
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,660
So these are the rights
we have in the state of nature

97
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,480
before there is any government.

98
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,330
In the case of life and liberty,
I can't take my own life.

99
00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:30,230
I can't sell myself into slavery
any more than I can take

100
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,140
somebody else's life
or take someone else

101
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,340
as a slave by force.

102
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,420
But how does that work
in the case of property?

103
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:46,940
Because it's essential to Locke's case
that private property can arise

104
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:50,130
even before there is
any government.

105
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,310
How can there be a right
to private property

106
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:58,360
even before there is any government?

107
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,110
Locke's famous answer
comes in Section 27.

108
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:08,260
"Every man has a property
in his own person.

109
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,740
This nobody has any right to
but himself."

110
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,500
"The labor of his body
and the work of his hands,

111
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,900
we may say, are properly his."

112
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,940
So he moves, as the libertarians
later would move,

113
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:32,180
from the idea that we own ourselves,
that we have property in our persons

114
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:35,740
to the closely connected idea
that we own our own labor.

115
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:43,220
And from that to the further claim
that whatever we mix our labor with

116
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,130
that is un-owned
becomes our property.

117
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,040
"Whatever he removes out
of the state that nature has provided,

118
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,230
and left it in,
he has mixed his labor with,

119
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,860
and joined it to something
that is his own, and thereby

120
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:01,660
makes it his property."

121
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,920
Why? Because the labor is
the unquestionable property

122
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,460
of the laborer and therefore,
no one but the laborer

123
00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:19,600
can have a right to what is joined to
or mixed with his labor.

124
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,700
And then he adds
this important provision,

125
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,760
"at least where there is enough,
and as good left in common for others."

126
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:35,420
But we not only acquire our property
in the fruits of the earth,

127
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,770
in the deer that we hunt,
in the fish that we catch

128
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,290
but also if we till and plow
and enclose the land and grow potatoes,

129
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,250
we own not only the potatoes
but the land, the earth.

130
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,580
"As much land as a man tills,
plants, improves, cultivates

131
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:03,580
and can use the product of,
so much is his property.

132
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,820
He by his labor encloses it
from the commons.

133
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,980
So the idea that rights are
unalienable seems to distance

134
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:17,220
Locke from the libertarian.

135
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,340
Libertarian wants to say
we have an absolute property right

136
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,900
in ourselves and therefore,
we can do with ourselves

137
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,380
whatever we want.

138
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,780
Locke is not a sturdy ally
for that view.

139
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,460
In fact, he says if you take
natural rights seriously,

140
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,740
you'll be led to the idea
that there are certain constraints

141
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:39,900
on what we can do
with our natural rights,

142
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,420
constraints given either by God
or by reason reflecting

143
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,120
on what it means really to be free,
and really to be free

144
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,090
means recognizing that our rights
are unalienable.

145
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,460
So here is the difference
between Locke and the libertarians.

146
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:01,720
But when it comes to Locke's
account of private property,

147
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,020
he begins to look again
like a pretty good ally

148
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,820
because his argument
for private property begins

149
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,030
with the idea that we are
the proprietors of our own person

150
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,860
and therefore, of our labor,
and therefore,

151
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,620
of the fruits of our labor,
including not only

152
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:26,180
the things we gather and hunt
in the state of nature

153
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,870
but also we acquire our property right
in the land that we enclose

154
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:33,560
and cultivate and improve.

155
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:39,700
There are some examples
that can bring out the moral intuition

156
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:47,450
that our labor can take something
that is unowned and make it ours,

157
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,880
though sometimes,
there are disputes about this.

158
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,000
There is a debate among
rich countries and developing countries

159
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:04,070
about trade-related
intellectual property rights.

160
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:08,360
It came to a head recently
over drug patent laws.

161
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,590
Western countries,
and especially the United States say,

162
00:13:11,849 --> 00:13:14,020
"We have a big
pharmaceutical industry

163
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,060
that develops new drugs.

164
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,660
We want all countries
in the world to agree

165
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,900
to respect the patents."

166
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,600
Then, there came along
the AIDS crisis in South Africa,

167
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:35,890
and the American AIDS drugs
were hugely expensive,

168
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,430
far more than could be afforded
by most Africans.

169
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,300
So the South African
government said,

170
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,580
"We are going to begin to buy
a generic version of the AIDS

171
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:53,550
antiretroviral drug
at a tiny fraction of the cost

172
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:57,670
because we can find an Indian
manufacturing company

173
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,520
that figures out how the thing
is made and produces it,

174
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:06,170
and for a tiny fraction of the cost,
we can save lives

175
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:08,730
if we don't respect that patent."

176
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,420
And then the American
government said,

177
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,960
"No, here is a company
that invested research

178
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,180
and created this drug.

179
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:24,500
You can't just start mass producing
these drugs without paying

180
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,040
a licensing fee."

181
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,440
And so there was a dispute
and the pharmaceutical company

182
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:36,780
sued the South African government
to try to prevent their buying

183
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:43,410
the cheap generic, as they saw it,
pirated version of an AIDS drug.

184
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,240
And eventually, the pharmaceutical
industry gave in and said,

185
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:51,000
"All right, you can do that."

186
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:56,060
But this dispute about
what the rules of property should be,

187
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:01,620
of intellectual property
of drug patenting, in a way,

188
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,350
is the last frontier of the state of nature
because among nations

189
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:11,100
where there is no uniform law
of patent rights and property rights,

190
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:15,360
it's up for grabs until,
by some act of consent,

191
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:23,420
some international agreement,
people enter into some settled rules.

192
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,100
What about Locke's account
of private property

193
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:34,690
and how it can arise
before government and before law

194
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,400
comes on the scene?
Is it successful?

195
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:43,100
How many think it's
pretty persuasive?

196
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,620
Raise your hand.

197
00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:49,580
How many don't find it persuasive?

198
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,630
All right, let's hear from some critics.

199
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:58,470
What is wrong with Locke's account
of how private property can arise

200
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,060
without consent? Yes?

201
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,060
Yes, I think it justifies European
cultural norms as far as

202
00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:11,790
when you look at how Native Americans
may not have cultivated American land,

203
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:17,410
but by their arrival in the Americas,
that contributed

204
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,460
to the development of America,
which wouldn't have otherwise

205
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:23,420
necessarily happened then
or by that specific group.

206
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,840
So you think that this is a defense,
this defense of private property in land...

207
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:31,300
Yes, because it complicates
original acquisition

208
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,900
if you only cite the arrival of foreigners
that cultivated the land.

209
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,300
I see. And what's your name?
- Rochelle.

210
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:39,790
Rochelle?
- Yes.

211
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:44,850
Rochelle says this account
of how property arises

212
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,140
would fit what was going on
in North America during the time

213
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,380
of the European settlement.

214
00:16:56,599 --> 00:17:01,780
Do you think, Rochelle,
that it's a way of defending

215
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,500
the appropriation of the land?

216
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,940
Indeed, because I mean,
he is also justifying

217
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,380
the glorious revolutions.

218
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,580
I don't think it's inconceivable
that he is also justifying

219
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,460
colonization as well.

220
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,340
Well, that's an interesting
historical suggestion

221
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,860
and I think there is a lot
to be said for it.

222
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,970
What do you think of the validity
of his argument though?

223
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,540
Because if you are right
that this would justify the taking

224
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,060
of land in North America
from Native Americans

225
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:39,970
who didn't enclose it,
if it's a good argument,

226
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,060
then Locke's given us
a justification for that.

227
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:46,770
If it's a bad argument,
then Locke's given us a mere

228
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:50,420
rationalization that isn't
morally defensible.

229
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,990
I'm leaning to the second one...
- You're leaning toward the second one.

230
00:17:55,149 --> 00:17:57,610
But that's my opinion as well.

231
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,420
All right, well, then,
let's hear if there is a defender

232
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:05,520
of Locke's account
of private property,

233
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,490
and it would be interesting
if they could address Rochelle's worry

234
00:18:10,639 --> 00:18:13,930
that this is just a way
of defending the appropriation

235
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:17,960
of land by the American colonists
from the Native Americans

236
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,020
who didn't enclose it.

237
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,400
Is there someone who will defend
Locke on that point?

238
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,710
Are you going to defend Locke?

239
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,350
Like, you're accusing him
of justifying the European

240
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,410
basically massacre of
the Native Americans.

241
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,060
But who says he is defending it?

242
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:39,460
Maybe the European colonization
isn't right.

243
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:42,720
You know, maybe it's the state
of war that he talked about

244
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,860
in his Second Treatise, you know.

245
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:51,180
So the wars between
the Native Americans and the colonists,

246
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:57,010
the settlers, that might have been
a state of war that we can only

247
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,000
emerge from by an agreement
or an act of consent

248
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:05,300
and that's what would have been
required fairly to resolve...

249
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:07,200
Yes, and both sides would have had
to agree to it and carry it out

250
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,700
and everything.

251
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,090
But what about when, what's your name?
- Dan.

252
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:17,140
But Dan, what about Rochelle
says this argument in Section 27

253
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,260
and then in 32
about appropriating land,

254
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,820
that argument, if it's valid,
would justify the settlers' appropriating

255
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,460
that land and excluding
others from it,

256
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,580
you think that argument
is a good argument?

257
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,620
Well, doesn't it kind of imply
that the Native Americans

258
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,620
hadn't already done that?

259
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,580
Well, the Native Americans,
as hunter-gatherers,

260
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,220
didn't actually enclose land.

261
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,780
So I think Rochelle is
onto something there.

262
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,660
What I want to -- go ahead, Dan.

263
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,020
At the same time,
he is saying that just by picking

264
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,540
an acorn or taking an apple
or maybe killing a buffalo

265
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,940
on a certain amount of land,
that makes it yours

266
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,460
because it's your labor and your labor
would enclose that land.

267
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,700
So by that definition,
maybe they didn't have fences

268
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:12,530
around little plots of land
but didn't...

269
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,840
They were using it.

270
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,820
Yes. By Locke's definition,
you can say...

271
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,020
So maybe by Locke's definition,
the Native Americans

272
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,940
could have claimed a property right
in the land itself.

273
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:24,660
Right, but they just didn't have
Locke on their side, as she points out.

274
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:30,270
All right, good. Okay, that's good.
One more defender of Locke. Go ahead.

275
00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:32,540
Well, I mean,
just to defend Locke,

276
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,580
he does say that
there are some times in which

277
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,260
you can't take
another person's land.

278
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,840
For example, you can't acquire
a land that is common property so people,

279
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,760
in terms of the American Indians,
I feel like they already have

280
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,540
civilizations themselves
and they were using land in common.

281
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,250
So it's kind of like what
an analogy to what he was talking about

282
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,610
with like the common English property.
You can't take land that

283
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,860
everybody is sharing in common.

284
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,200
Oh, that's interesting. That's interesting.

285
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,360
And also, you can't take land
unless you make sure

286
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,280
that there is as much land as possible
left for other people to take as well.

287
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,050
So if you're taking common,
so you have to make sure

288
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,220
that whenever you take land
that there is enough left

289
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,820
for other people to use...
- Right.

290
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,070
...that's just as good as
the land that you took, so...

291
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,900
That's true.
Locke says there has to be this right

292
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,600
to private property in the earth
is subject to the provision

293
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:26,040
that there be as much and as good
left for others. What's your name?

294
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,480
Right. I'm Feng.

295
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,100
So Feng, in a way,
agrees with Dan that maybe there is

296
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,180
a claim within Locke's framework
that could be developed on behalf

297
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:40,540
of the Native Americans.
Here is the further question.

298
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:47,460
If the right to private property
is natural, not conventional,

299
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:53,980
if it's something that we acquire
even before we agree to government,

300
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:59,900
how does that right constrain
what a legitimate government can do?

301
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:10,220
In order, finally,
to see whether Locke is an ally

302
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:17,620
or potentially a critic of the
libertarian idea of the state,

303
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,560
we have to ask what becomes
of our natural rights

304
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,530
once we enter into society.

305
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:28,390
We know that the way we enter into society
is by consent, by agreement

306
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:32,800
to leave the state of nature
and to be governed by the majority

307
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:36,060
and by a system of laws,
human laws.

308
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:42,740
But those human laws
are only legitimate

309
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:50,600
if they respect our natural rights,
if they respect our unalienable rights

310
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:59,380
to life, liberty, and property.
No parliament, no legislature,

311
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:06,670
however democratic its credentials,
can legitimately violate

312
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,140
our natural rights.

313
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:17,380
This idea that no law can violate
our right to life, liberty, and property

314
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,780
would seem to support the idea
of a government so limited

315
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:29,620
that it would gladden the heart
of the libertarian after all.

316
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,620
But those hearts should not be
so quickly gladdened because

317
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,380
even though for Locke,
the law of nature persists

318
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,660
once government arrives,
even though Locke insists

319
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:50,700
on limited government,
government limited by the end

320
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,170
for which it was created,
namely the preservation of property,

321
00:23:54,510 --> 00:24:00,820
even so, there is an important sense
in which what counts as my property,

322
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:07,600
what counts as respecting
my life and liberty

323
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,220
are for the government to define.

324
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:19,510
That there be property,
that there be respect

325
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:26,490
for life and liberty
is what limits government.

326
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:37,410
But what counts as respecting
my life and respecting my property,

327
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:43,210
that is for governments
to decide and to define.

328
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,700
How can that be?

329
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,600
Is Locke contradicting himself
or is there an important

330
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:54,140
distinction here?

331
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:58,070
In order to answer that question,
which will decide Locke's fit

332
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,100
with the libertarian view,
we need to look closely

333
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,180
at what legitimate government
looks like for Locke,

334
00:25:05,649 --> 00:25:08,220
and we turn to that next time.

335
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,260
Nicola, if you didn't think
you'd get caught,

336
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,480
would you pay your taxes?

337
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:28,610
I don't think so.
I would rather have a system

338
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:34,340
personally that I could give money
to exactly those sections

339
00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:38,930
of the government that I support
and not just blanket support of it.

340
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,420
You'd rather be in the
state of nature,

341
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,350
at least on April 15th.

342
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:57,420
Last time, we began to discuss
Locke's state of nature,

343
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:05,210
his account of private property,
his theory of legitimate government,

344
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:10,100
which is government based on consent
and also limited government.

345
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,190
Locke believes in certain
fundamental rights that constrain

346
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,230
what government can do,
and he believes that those rights

347
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,940
are natural rights,
not rights that flow from law

348
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,790
or from government.

349
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:32,090
And so Locke's great
philosophical experiment

350
00:26:32,189 --> 00:26:37,450
is to see if he can give an account
of how there could be a right

351
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:44,610
to private property without consent
before government and legislators

352
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,930
arrive on the scene to define property.

353
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:51,220
That's his question. That's his claim.

354
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:55,100
There is a way Locke argues
to create property,

355
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,420
not just in the things
we gather and hunt,

356
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:02,780
but in the land itself,
provided there is enough

357
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,580
and as good left for others.

358
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:09,520
Today, I want to turn
to the question of consent,

359
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,220
which is Locke's second big idea.

360
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,820
Private property is one;
consent is the other.

361
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:22,530
What is the work of consent?

362
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,360
People here have been
invoking the idea of consent

363
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,000
since we began
since the first week.

364
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,100
Do you remember
when we were talking about

365
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:34,900
pushing the fat man off the bridge,
someone said,

366
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,550
"But he didn't agree
to sacrifice himself.

367
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,380
It would be different
if he consented."

368
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,780
Or when we were talking
about the cabin boy,

369
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,700
killing and eating the cabin boy.

370
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:51,660
Some people said,
"Well, if they had consented

371
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,460
to a lottery, it would be different.

372
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,380
Then it would be all right."

373
00:27:55,699 --> 00:27:59,780
So consent has come up
a lot and here in John Locke,

374
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:04,260
we have one of the great
philosophers of consent.

375
00:28:05,699 --> 00:28:08,500
Consent is an obvious
familiar idea in moral

376
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,200
and political philosophy.

377
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,100
Locke says that legitimate
government is government founded

378
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,900
on consent and who, nowadays,
would disagree with him?

379
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,660
Sometimes, when the ideas
of political philosophers

380
00:28:22,879 --> 00:28:28,200
are as familiar as Locke's ideas
about consent,

381
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:32,660
it's hard to make sense of them
or at least to find them very interesting.

382
00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:36,640
But there are some puzzles,
some strange features

383
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,030
of Locke's account of consent

384
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,900
as the basis of
legitimate government

385
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,300
and that's what
I'd like to take up today.

386
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:53,590
One way of testing
the plausibility of Locke's idea

387
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:57,850
of consent and also of probing
some of its perplexities

388
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,380
is to ask just what
a legitimate government

389
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,540
founded on consent can do,
what are its powers

390
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,700
according to Locke.

391
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,590
Well, in order to answer
that question,

392
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:20,780
it helps to remember
what the state of nature is like.

393
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,360
Remember, the state of nature
is the condition that

394
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:30,780
we decide to leave,
and that's what gives rise to consent.

395
00:29:31,129 --> 00:29:34,700
Why not stay there?
Why bother with government at all?

396
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,200
Well, what is Locke's answer
to that question?

397
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:42,500
He says there are some inconveniences
in the state of nature

398
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,580
but what are those
inconveniences?

399
00:29:45,889 --> 00:29:52,350
The main inconvenience
is that everyone can enforce

400
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,540
the law of nature.

401
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:57,460
Everyone is an enforcer,
or what Locke calls

402
00:29:57,639 --> 00:30:05,540
"the executor" of the state of nature,
and he means executor literally.

403
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,980
If someone violates
the law of nature,

404
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:15,590
he is an aggressor.
He is beyond reason

405
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,760
and you can punish him.

406
00:30:21,129 --> 00:30:23,720
And you don't have to be
too careful or fine about

407
00:30:23,879 --> 00:30:27,220
gradations of punishment
in the state of nature.

408
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,210
You can kill him.
You can certainly kill

409
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:34,630
someone who comes after you,
who tries to murder you.

410
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,100
That's self defense.

411
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:39,940
But the enforcement power,
the right to punish,

412
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:42,810
everyone can do the punishing
in the state of nature.

413
00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:45,630
And not only can you punish
with death people

414
00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:50,280
who come after you seeking
to take your life,

415
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,240
you can also punish a thief
who tries to steal your goods

416
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:57,990
because that also counts
as aggression against

417
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,450
the law of nature.

418
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:04,420
If someone has stolen
from a third party,

419
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:08,800
you can go after him. Why is this?

420
00:31:09,189 --> 00:31:13,400
Well, violations of the law of nature
are an act of aggression.

421
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:18,580
There is no police force.
There are no judges, no juries,

422
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:23,310
so everyone is the judge
in his or her own case.

423
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:27,670
And Locke observes that
when people are the judges

424
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:31,300
of their own cases,
they tend to get carried away,

425
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,950
and this gives rise
to the inconvenience

426
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,450
in the state of nature.

427
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:41,330
People overshoot the mark.
There is aggression.

428
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,740
There is punishment
and before you know it,

429
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,070
everybody is insecure
in the enjoyment of his or her

430
00:31:51,459 --> 00:31:55,200
unalienable rights to life,
liberty, and property.

431
00:31:56,709 --> 00:32:02,300
Now, he describes in pretty harsh
and even grim terms

432
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:07,710
what you can do to people
who violate the law of nature.

433
00:32:07,889 --> 00:32:11,320
"One may destroy a man
who makes war upon him ...

434
00:32:11,469 --> 00:32:15,420
for the same reason that
he may kill a wolf or a lion.

435
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:19,780
Such men have no other rule,
but that of force and violence,"

436
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,680
listen to this, "and so may be
treated as beasts of prey, those

437
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:31,240
dangerous and noxious creatures,
that will be sure to destroy to you

438
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:35,850
if you fall into their power",
so kill them first.

439
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:44,020
So, what starts out as a seemingly
benign state of nature

440
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,840
where everyone is free
and yet where there is a law

441
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,890
and the law respects people's rights,
and those rights are so powerful

442
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,850
that they're unalienable.

443
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:59,310
What starts out looking very benign,
once you look closer,

444
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:05,890
is pretty fierce and filled with violence,
and that's why people want to leave.

445
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:11,900
How do they leave?
Well, here is where consent comes in.

446
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,790
The only way to escape
from the state of nature

447
00:33:16,169 --> 00:33:26,890
is to undertake an act of consent
where you agree to give up

448
00:33:27,219 --> 00:33:31,610
the enforcement power
and to create a government

449
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:39,940
or a community where there will be
a legislature to make law

450
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:46,350
and where everyone agrees in advance,
everyone who enters,

451
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:51,490
agrees in advance to abide by
whatever the majority decides.

452
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,480
But then the question,
and this is our question

453
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,260
and here is where I want
to get your views,

454
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:01,890
then the question is what powers,
what can the majority decide?

455
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:07,610
Now, here, it gets tricky for Locke
because you remember,

456
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:11,870
alongside the whole story
about consent and majority rule,

457
00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:15,080
there are these natural rights,
the law of nature,

458
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,940
these unalienable rights,
and you remember,

459
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:25,040
they don't disappear when people
join together to create a civil society.

460
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:29,820
So even once the majority
is in charge,

461
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:36,690
the majority can't violate
your inalienable rights,

462
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,300
can't violate your
fundamental right to life,

463
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,760
liberty, and property.

464
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,330
So here is the puzzle.

465
00:34:46,009 --> 00:34:48,290
How much power
does the majority have?

466
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:52,880
How limited is the government
created by consent?

467
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:01,890
It's limited by the obligation
on the part of the majority

468
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:09,550
to respect and to enforce the fundamental
natural rights of the citizens.

469
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:11,180
They don't give those up.
We don't give those up

470
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,440
when we enter government.

471
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,310
That's this powerful idea
taken over from Locke

472
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:23,900
by Jefferson in the Declaration.
Unalienable rights.

473
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:29,740
So, let's go to our two cases.
Remember Michael Jordan, Bill Gates,

474
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,660
the libertarian objection
to taxation for redistribution?

475
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,140
Well, what about Locke's
limited government?

476
00:35:36,529 --> 00:35:43,480
Is there anyone who thinks
that Locke does give grounds

477
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:48,340
for opposing taxation
for redistribution?

478
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:53,300
Anybody? Go ahead.

479
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:58,740
If the majority rules
that there should be taxation,

480
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,580
even if the minority should still
not have to be taxed

481
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:08,740
because that's taking away property,
which is one of the rights of nature.

482
00:36:09,259 --> 00:36:12,360
All right so, and what's your name?
- Ben.

483
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:19,800
Ben. So if the majority
taxes the minority

484
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,730
without the consent
of the minority

485
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:29,330
to that particular tax law,
it does amount to a taking

486
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,030
of their property
without their consent

487
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,980
and it would seem that Locke
should object to that.

488
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,250
You want some textual support
for your view,

489
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,260
for your reading of Locke, Ben?

490
00:36:45,299 --> 00:36:46,200
Sure.

491
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,000
All right. I brought some along
just in case you raised it.

492
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,780
If you have your texts,
look at 138, passage 138.

493
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:02,210
"The supreme power,"
by which Locke means the legislature,

494
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,430
"cannot take from any man
any part of his property

495
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:09,040
without his own consent,
for the preservation of property

496
00:37:09,259 --> 00:37:11,850
being the end of government
and that for which men

497
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,830
enter into society,
it necessarily supposes

498
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,810
and requires that people
should have property."

499
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,310
That was the whole reason
for entering society in the first place,

500
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,300
to protect the right to property.

501
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,790
And when Locke speaks about
the right to property,

502
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,990
he often uses that as a kind
of global term for the whole category,

503
00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:33,150
the right to life, liberty,
and property.

504
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,620
So that part of Locke,
that beginning of 138,

505
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:46,420
seems to support Ben's reading.
But what about the part of 138,

506
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,280
if you keep reading,
"Men, therefore, in society

507
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:54,490
having property, they have such a right
to the goods,

508
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:59,840
which by the law
of the community are theirs."

509
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,880
Look at this.

510
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:06,110
"And that no one can take
from them without their consent."

511
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:10,380
And then at the end
of this passage, he says,

512
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,690
"So it's a mistake to think
that the legislative power

513
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:17,340
can do what it will and dispose
of the estates of the subject arbitrarily

514
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:20,870
or take any part of them at pleasure."

515
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,560
Here's what's elusive.

516
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,320
On the one hand,
he says the government

517
00:38:27,529 --> 00:38:29,380
can't take your property
without your consent.

518
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:34,250
He is clear about that.
But then he goes on to say,

519
00:38:34,339 --> 00:38:36,260
and that's the natural right
to property.

520
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,440
But then, it seems that property,
what counts as property

521
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,220
is not natural
but conventional

522
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,670
defined by the government.

523
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:50,910
"The goods of which
by the law of the community are theirs."

524
00:38:52,549 --> 00:38:57,520
And the plot thickens
if you look ahead to Section 140.

525
00:38:58,529 --> 00:39:00,700
In 140, he says,
"Governments can't be supported

526
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:01,830
without great charge.

527
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:05,120
Government is expensive
and it's fit that everyone

528
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,080
who enjoys his share
of the protection

529
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,720
should pay out of his estate."

530
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,820
And then here is the crucial line.
"But still, it must be

531
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:19,740
with his own consent,
i.e. the consent of the majority,

532
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,180
giving it either by themselves,

533
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,580
or through their representatives."
So what is Locke actually saying?

534
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,180
Property is natural in one sense
but conventional in another.

535
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,100
It's natural in the sense
that we have a fundamental

536
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:40,140
unalienable right that
there be property,

537
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,830
that the institution of property
exist and be respected

538
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,450
by the government.

539
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:49,560
So an arbitrary taking of property
would be a violation

540
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,810
of the law of nature
and would be illegitimate.

541
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:58,980
But it's a further question,
here is the conventional

542
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,940
aspect of property,
it's a further question

543
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,700
what counts as property,
how it's defined and what counts

544
00:40:08,569 --> 00:40:12,520
as taking property,
and that's up to the government.

545
00:40:13,089 --> 00:40:18,080
So the consent, here,
we're coming back

546
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:21,660
to our question,
what is the work of consent?

547
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,950
What it takes for taxation
to be legitimate

548
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:30,260
is that it be by consent,
not the consent of Bill Gates himself

549
00:40:30,589 --> 00:40:33,290
if he is the one who has
to pay the tax,

550
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,300
but by the consent
that he and we,

551
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:39,260
all of us within the society,
gave when we emerged

552
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,300
from the state of nature
and created the government

553
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,780
in the first place.
It's the collective consent.

554
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:56,390
And by that reading,
it looks like consent is doing

555
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:02,100
a whole lot and the limited
government consent creates

556
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:05,080
isn't all that limited.

557
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:11,770
Does anyone want to respond
to that or have a question about that?

558
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,050
Go ahead. Stand up.

559
00:41:15,859 --> 00:41:19,550
Well, I'm just wondering
what Locke's view is on

560
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,780
once you have a government
that's already in place,

561
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,470
whether it is possible
for people who are born

562
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:29,340
into that government
to then leave and return

563
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,220
to the state of nature?
I mean, I don't think

564
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,330
that Locke mentioned
that at all in the...

565
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:36,380
What do you think?

566
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:43,780
Well, I think, as the convention,
it would be very difficult to leave

567
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:49,080
the government
because you are no longer,

568
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,860
because nobody else is
just living in the state of nature.

569
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,790
Everybody else is now
governed by this legislature.

570
00:41:58,259 --> 00:42:00,020
What would it mean today,
you're asking.

571
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,740
And what's your name?
- Nicola.

572
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,860
Nicola, to leave the state.
Supposed you wanted to leave

573
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:09,860
civil society today.
You want to withdraw your consent

574
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,710
and return to the state of nature.

575
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,340
Well, because you didn't
actually consent to it.

576
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:18,780
You were just born into it.
It was your ancestors who joined.

577
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:24,720
Right. You didn't sign
the social contract. I didn't sign it.

578
00:42:24,819 --> 00:42:25,500
Exactly.

579
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:29,450
All right, so what does
Locke say there? Yes?

580
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,220
I don't think Locke says
you have to sign anything.

581
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,860
I think that he says
that it's kind of implied consent.

582
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,700
Implied?

583
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,700
Taking government's services,
you are implying that

584
00:42:38,799 --> 00:42:39,850
you are consenting
to the government

585
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,540
taking things from you.

586
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,680
All right, so implied consent.
That's a partial answer

587
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,760
to this challenge.
Now, you may not think

588
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:49,570
that implied consent
is as good as the real thing.

589
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,780
Is that what you're shaking
your head about, Nicola?

590
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,860
Speak up. Stand up and speak up.

591
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,290
I don't think that necessarily
just by utilizing the government's

592
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:05,780
various resources that we are
necessarily implying that

593
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,410
we agree with the way
that this government was formed

594
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,610
or that we have consented
to actually join into the social contract.

595
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,830
So you don't think the idea
of implied consent

596
00:43:19,049 --> 00:43:21,820
is strong enough to generate
any obligation at all to obey

597
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,140
the government?

598
00:43:23,779 --> 00:43:25,350
Not necessarily, no.

599
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,750
Nicola, if you didn't think
you'd get caught,

600
00:43:29,799 --> 00:43:31,780
would you pay your taxes?

601
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:40,190
I don't think so. I would rather
have a system, personally,

602
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:45,340
that I could give money to
exactly those sections

603
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,820
of the government
that I support

604
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,780
and not just blanket support of it.

605
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,350
You'd rather be
in the state of nature,

606
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,380
at least on April 15th.

607
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:00,430
But what I'm trying to get at
is do you consider that

608
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,280
you are under no obligation,
since you haven't actually entered

609
00:44:03,569 --> 00:44:07,130
into any act of consent,
but for prudential reasons,

610
00:44:07,279 --> 00:44:09,810
you do what you're supposed
o do according to the law?

611
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,540
Exactly.

612
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,590
If you look at it that way,
then you're violating another one

613
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:16,700
of Locke's treatises,
which is that you can't take

614
00:44:16,799 --> 00:44:21,280
anything from anyone else.
Like, you can't take the government's

615
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,730
services and then not give them
anything in return.

616
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,620
If you want to go live
in the state of nature, that's fine,

617
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,450
but you can't take anything
from the government

618
00:44:30,549 --> 00:44:32,380
because by the government's terms,
which are the only terms

619
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,540
under which you
can enter the agreement,

620
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:36,860
say that you have to pay taxes
to take those things.

621
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,180
So you are saying that Nicola
can go back into the state of nature

622
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,800
if she wants to but
she can't drive on Mass. Ave.?

623
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,100
Exactly.

624
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,340
I want to raise the stakes
beyond using Mass. Ave.

625
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,400
and even beyond taxation.

626
00:44:51,629 --> 00:44:55,460
What about life?
What about military conscription?

627
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,460
Yes, what do you say? Stand up.

628
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,630
First of all, we have to remember
that sending people to war

629
00:45:02,779 --> 00:45:05,570
is not necessarily implying
that they'll die.

630
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:08,620
I mean, obviously,
you're not raising their chances here

631
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:11,960
but it's not a death penalty.

632
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,380
So if you're going to discuss
whether or not

633
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:18,180
military conscription
is equivalent to suppressing

634
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:21,810
people's right to life,
you shouldn't approach it that way.

635
00:45:22,759 --> 00:45:25,880
Secondly, the real problem here
is Locke has this view

636
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:31,010
about consent and natural rights.
But you're not allowed to give up

637
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:34,260
your natural rights either.
So the real question is

638
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:38,420
how does he himself
figure it out between

639
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:43,250
"I agree to give up my life,
give up my property"

640
00:45:43,509 --> 00:45:47,020
when he talks about taxes
or military conscription for the fact.

641
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,940
But I guess Locke would be
against suicide,

642
00:45:50,279 --> 00:45:53,470
and that's still my own consent.
I agree by taking my life.

643
00:45:53,569 --> 00:45:55,500
All right, good. All right, what's your name?
- Eric.

644
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,540
So Eric brings us back
to the puzzle we've been

645
00:45:57,759 --> 00:46:00,700
wrestling with since we
started reading Locke.

646
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:04,260
On the one hand,
we have these unalienable rights

647
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,430
to life, liberty, and property,
which means that even we

648
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,660
don't have the power
to give them up,

649
00:46:10,879 --> 00:46:14,440
and that's what creates
the limits on legitimate government.

650
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:17,680
It's not what we consent to
that limits government.

651
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:21,700
It's what we lack the power
to give away

652
00:46:23,529 --> 00:46:25,620
when we consent
that limits government.

653
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:32,420
That's the point at the heart
of Locke's whole account

654
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,430
of legitimate government.

655
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:39,360
But now, you say, "well, if we can't
give up our own life,

656
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:43,120
if we can't commit suicide,
if we can't give up our right

657
00:46:43,299 --> 00:46:45,260
to property,
how can we then agree

658
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:49,110
to be bound by a majority
that will force us to sacrifice

659
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:51,850
our lives or give up our property"?

660
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:57,380
Does Locke have a way out
of this or is he basically

661
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:03,980
sanctioning
an all-powerful government,

662
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:09,170
despite everything he says
about unalienable rights?

663
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,020
Does he have a way out of it?
Who would speak here

664
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,960
in defense of Locke or make sense,
find a way out of this predicament?

665
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,760
Yes.
- All right, go ahead.

666
00:47:17,879 --> 00:47:19,850
I feel like there is a general
distinction we made between

667
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:22,460
the right to life
that individuals possess

668
00:47:22,569 --> 00:47:24,690
and the fact that the government
cannot take away

669
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:27,740
a single individual's right to life.

670
00:47:28,549 --> 00:47:32,160
I think if you look at conscription
as the government picking out

671
00:47:32,359 --> 00:47:35,420
certain individuals to go fight in war,
then that would be a violation

672
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,790
of their natural right to life.
On the other hand,

673
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:43,370
if you have conscription,
let's say a lottery for example,

674
00:47:44,009 --> 00:47:48,430
then in that case I would view that
as the population picking

675
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:51,220
their representatives
to defend them in the case of war,

676
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,210
the idea being that
since the whole population

677
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,900
cannot go out there
to defend its own right to property,

678
00:47:56,129 --> 00:47:59,530
it picks its own representatives
through a process that's essentially

679
00:47:59,819 --> 00:48:03,300
random and then these sort
of elected representatives

680
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,880
go out and fight for the rights
of the people.

681
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,410
It works very similar,
it works just like

682
00:48:09,509 --> 00:48:11,840
an elected government, in my opinion.

683
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,580
All right, so an elected government
can conscript citizens

684
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,560
to go out and defend
the way of life,

685
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:23,060
the community that makes
the enjoyment of rights possible?

686
00:48:23,279 --> 00:48:27,480
I think it can because to me,
it seems that it's very similar

687
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:31,720
to the process of electing
representatives for legislature.

688
00:48:32,129 --> 00:48:37,830
Although here,
it's as if the government

689
00:48:38,029 --> 00:48:44,250
is electing by conscription
certain citizens to go die

690
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:49,220
for the sake of the whole.
Is that consistent with respect

691
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:51,440
for a natural right to liberty?

692
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,720
Well, what I would say
there is there is a distinction

693
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:58,880
between picking out individuals
and having a random

694
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,020
choice of individuals. Like ...

695
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,720
Between picking out...
let me make sure,

696
00:49:02,799 --> 00:49:06,930
between picking out individuals,
let me... what's your name?

697
00:49:07,109 --> 00:49:08,500
Gokul.

698
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:11,760
Gokul says there's a difference
between picking out individuals

699
00:49:11,859 --> 00:49:16,070
to lay down their lives
and having a general law.

700
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:22,500
I think this is the answer
Locke would give, actually, Gokul.

701
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,740
Locke is against
arbitrary government.

702
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:30,940
He is against the arbitrary taking,
the singling out of Bill Gates

703
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,660
to finance the war in Iraq.
He is against singling out

704
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,860
a particular citizen
or group of people

705
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:42,340
to go off and fight.
But if there is a general law

706
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,620
such that the
government's choice,

707
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:49,500
the majority's action
is non-arbitrary,

708
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:58,180
it doesn't really amount
to a violation of people's basic rights.

709
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,760
What does count as a violation
is an arbitrary taking

710
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,940
because that would essentially say,
not only to Bill Gates,

711
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:08,540
but to everyone,
there is no rule of law.

712
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:14,660
There is no institution of property.
Because at the whim of the king,

713
00:50:14,759 --> 00:50:16,600
or for that matter,
of the parliament,

714
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:23,130
we can name you or you
to give up your property

715
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,920
or to give up your life.
But so long as there is

716
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:34,900
a non-arbitrary rule of law,
then it's permissible.

717
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:40,080
Now, you may say this doesn't
amount to a very limited government,

718
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,960
and the libertarian may complain
that Locke is not

719
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,570
such a terrific ally after all.

720
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:50,220
The libertarian has two grounds
for disappointment in Locke.

721
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:55,860
First, that the rights
are unalienable and therefore,

722
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,780
I don't really own myself
after all.

723
00:50:59,299 --> 00:51:02,910
I can't dispose of my life
or my liberty or my property

724
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:07,490
in a way that violates my rights.
That's disappointment number one.

725
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:12,080
Disappointment number two,
once there is a legitimate government

726
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:16,810
based on consent,
the only limits for Locke

727
00:51:17,879 --> 00:51:23,940
are limits on arbitrary takings
of life or of liberty or of property.

728
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,060
But if the majority decides,
if the majority promulgates

729
00:51:27,279 --> 00:51:34,900
a generally applicable law
and if it votes duly according

730
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:39,620
to fair procedures,
then there is no violation,

731
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:44,780
whether it's a system of taxation
or a system of conscription.

732
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,790
So it's clear that
Locke is worried

733
00:51:48,129 --> 00:51:52,290
about the absolute arbitrary
power of kings,

734
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:56,100
but it's also true,
and here is the

735
00:51:56,430 --> 00:52:01,010
darker side of Locke,
that this great theorist of consent

736
00:52:01,109 --> 00:52:02,920
came up with a theory
of private property

737
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:08,620
that didn't require consent
that may,

738
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:12,290
and this goes back
to the point Rochelle made last time,

739
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:16,260
may have had something to do
with Locke's second concern,

740
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:18,300
which was America.

741
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,820
You remember,
when he talks about

742
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,120
the state of nature,
he is not talking about

743
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:27,160
an imaginary place.
"In the beginning," he says,

744
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:30,970
"All the world was America."
And what was going on in America?

745
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:37,760
The settlers were enclosing land
and engaged in wars

746
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:40,140
with the Native Americans.

747
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:46,070
Locke, who was an administrator
of one of the colonies,

748
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:51,100
may have been as interested
in providing a justification

749
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:55,870
for private property
through enclosure without consent

750
00:52:56,069 --> 00:53:01,100
through enclosure and cultivation,
as he was with developing a theory

751
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:06,840
of government based on consent
that would rein in kings

752
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,660
and arbitrary rulers.

753
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:12,820
The question we're left with,
the fundamental question

754
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:17,000
we still haven't answered
is what then becomes of consent?

755
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:20,290
What work can it do?
What is its moral force?

756
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:24,900
What are the limits of consent?
Consent matters not only

757
00:53:25,069 --> 00:53:27,820
for governments,
but also for markets.

758
00:53:28,279 --> 00:53:32,310
And beginning next time,
we're going to take up questions

759
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:37,500
of the limits of consent
in the buying and selling of goods.

760
00:53:45,899 --> 00:53:47,900
