1
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,900
Now we turn

2
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:36,100
Now we turn to the hardest philosopher
we're going to read in this course.

3
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,380
Today we turn to Immanuel Kant

4
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,420
who offers a
different account

5
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,260
of why we have a
categorical duty

6
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,140
to respect the
dignity of persons

7
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,700
and not to use people
as means merely

8
00:00:58,279 --> 00:00:59,820
even for good ends.

9
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,060
Kant excelled at the
University of Konigsberg

10
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,980
at the age of 16.

11
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,620
At age of 31, he got his first job
as an unsalaried lecturer

12
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:15,540
paid on commission based on
the number of students

13
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,540
who showed up at his lectures.

14
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,700
This is a sensible system that
Harvard would do well to consider.

15
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,300
Luckily for Kant,
he was a popular lecturer

16
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:35,020
and also an industrious one

17
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,100
and so he eked out a meager living.

18
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:43,420
It wasn't until he was 57
that he published his first major work.

19
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:46,140
But, it was worth the wait,

20
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:48,500
the book was the
"Critique of Pure Reason"

21
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:52,780
perhaps the most important work
in all of modern philosophy.

22
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,220
And a few years later, Kant wrote the
groundwork for "Metaphysics of Morals"

23
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,380
which we read in this course.

24
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,540
I want to acknowledge
even before we start

25
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,260
that Kant is a difficult thinker

26
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,740
but it's important to try
to figure what he's saying

27
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,940
because what this book is about

28
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:24,180
is what the supreme principle
of morality is,

29
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:25,820
number one,

30
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,580
and it also gives us an account 每

31
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,860
one of the most powerful
accounts we have 每

32
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,980
of what freedom really is.

33
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,380
So, let me start today,

34
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,940
Kant rejects utilitarianism.

35
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:44,980
He thinks that

36
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,860
the individual person,

37
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,020
all human beings,

38
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:59,100
have a certain dignity
that commands our respect.

39
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,860
The reason the individual is sacred
or the bearer of rights,

40
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,380
according to Kant,

41
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,850
doesn't stem from the idea
that we own ourselves

42
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,620
but instead from the idea
that we are all rational beings.

43
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,700
We're all rational beings,
which simply means

44
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,620
that we are beings
who are capable of reason.

45
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,500
We are also autonomous beings,

46
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,740
which is to say that we are beings
capable of acting and choosing freely.

47
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:47,660
Now, this capacity
for reason and freedom

48
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,750
isn't the only capacity we have.

49
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,020
We also have the capacity
for pain and pleasure,

50
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:57,260
for suffering and satisfaction.

51
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,020
Kant admits the utilitarians
were half right.

52
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,080
Of course,
we seek to avoid pain

53
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,560
and we like pleasure,

54
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:17,400
Kant doesn't deny this.

55
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,000
What he does deny

56
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,720
is Bentham's claim

57
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,820
that pain and pleasure
are our sovereign masters.

58
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,380
He thinks that's wrong.

59
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,860
Kant thinks that it's
our rational capacity

60
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:38,740
that makes us distinctive,

61
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,820
that makes us special,

62
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,700
that sets us apart from and above
mere animal existence.

63
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:53,140
It makes us something more than
just physical creatures with appetites.

64
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:03,900
We often think of freedom as
simply consisting in doing what we want

65
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,260
or in the absence of obstacles
to getting what we want,

66
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:12,340
that's one way of
thinking about freedom.

67
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,980
But this isn't Kant's idea of freedom.

68
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,380
Kant has a more stringent
demanding notion

69
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,580
of what it means
to be free.

70
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,820
And though it's stringent
and demanding,

71
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,940
if you think it through,
it's actually pretty persuasive.

72
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,660
Kant reasons as follows:

73
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,700
when we,
like animals,

74
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,060
seek after pleasure
or the satisfaction of our desires

75
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,660
or the avoidance of pain,

76
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,300
when we do that
we aren't really acting freely.

77
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,990
Why not?

78
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:59,260
We're really acting as the slaves
of those appetites and impulses.

79
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,500
I didn't choose this particular hunger
or that particular appetite

80
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,300
and so when I act to satisfy it,

81
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,860
I'm just acting according
to natural necessity.

82
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,160
And for Kant,
freedom is the opposite of necessity.

83
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:29,820
There was an advertising slogan for
the soft drink Sprite a few years ago.

84
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,460
The slogan was,
"Obey your thirst."

85
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:43,580
There's a Kantian insight buried in
that Sprite advertising slogan

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,260
that in a way is Kant's point.

87
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,140
When you go for Sprite or Pepsi,
you're really 每

88
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:54,820
you might think that
you're choosing freely,

89
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,380
Sprite versus Pepsi,

90
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,340
but you're actually
obeying something,

91
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,260
a thirst or maybe a desire manufactured
or massaged by advertising,

92
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:12,180
you're obeying a prompting that you
yourself haven't chosen or created.

93
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:24,580
And here it is worth noticing Kant's
specially demanding idea of freedom.

94
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,300
What way of acting 每
how can my will be determined

95
00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:32,460
if not by the promptings of nature

96
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:35,820
or my hunger or my appetite
or my desires?

97
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,500
Kant's answer?

98
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:43,600
To act freely is to act autonomously,

99
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:47,420
and to act autonomously
is to act according to a law

100
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,900
that I give myself

101
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,780
not according to the
physical laws of nature

102
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,220
or the laws of cause and effect

103
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:00,060
which include my desire
to eat or to drink

104
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,140
or to choose this

105
00:08:05,429 --> 00:08:06,950
food in a restaurant
over that.

106
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,220
Now, what is the opposite

107
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:17,500
of autonomy for Kant?

108
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:20,770
He invents a special term

109
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,580
to describe the
opposite of autonomy.

110
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,440
Heteronomy is the
opposite of autonomy.

111
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:37,200
When I act heteronomously,
I'm acting according to an inclination,

112
00:08:38,199 --> 00:08:41,950
or a desire,
that I haven't chosen for myself.

113
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:52,460
So, freedom as autonomy is an especially
stringent idea that Kant insists on.

114
00:08:55,449 --> 00:09:00,930
Now, why is autonomy the opposite
of acting heteronomously

115
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,980
or according to
the dictates of nature?

116
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,240
Kant's point is that
nature is governed by laws,

117
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,480
laws of cause and effect for example.

118
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,850
Suppose you drop
a billiard ball,

119
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,960
it falls to the ground;

120
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,320
we wouldn't say the billiard ball
is acting freely.

121
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:27,070
Why not?

122
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,060
It's acting according
to the law of nature,

123
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,450
according to the laws
of cause of effect,

124
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,860
the law of gravity.

125
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:39,110
And just as he has an unusually
demanding and stringent

126
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:41,100
conception of freedom,

127
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,870
freedom as autonomy,

128
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:50,420
he also has a demanding
conception of morality.

129
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,450
To act freely is not to choose
the best means to a given end;

130
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,500
it's to choose the end itself
for its own sake.

131
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,550
And that's something
that human beings can do

132
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,980
and that billiard balls can't.

133
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,380
In so far as we act on inclination
or pursue pleasure,

134
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,780
we act as means to the realization
of ends given outside us.

135
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:31,380
We are instruments rather than authors
of the purposes we pursue,

136
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,220
that's the heteronymous
determination of the will.

137
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,420
On the other hand,
in so far as we act autonomously,

138
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,590
according to a law
we give ourselves,

139
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,900
we do something for its own sake
as an end in itself.

140
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,260
When we act autonomously,
we seize to be instruments

141
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:53,900
to purposes given outside us,

142
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:57,690
we become,
or we can come to think of ourselves

143
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,780
as ends in ourselves.

144
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:07,800
This capacity to act freely,
Kant tells us,

145
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,780
is what gives human life
its special dignity.

146
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:15,740
Respecting human dignity
means regarding persons

147
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:20,100
not just as means
but also as ends in themselves.

148
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,220
And this is why it's wrong
to use people

149
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,220
for the sake of other peoples'
well-being or happiness.

150
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,300
This is the real reason,
Kant says,

151
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,750
that utilitarianism goes wrong.

152
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,100
This is the reason it's important
to respect the dignity of persons

153
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,620
and to uphold their rights.

154
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:49,620
So, even if there are cases,
remember John Stewart Mill said,

155
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:51,730
"Well, in the long run,
if we uphold justice

156
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,820
and respect the
dignity of persons,

157
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:56,620
we will maximize
human happiness."

158
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:00,100
What would Kant's
answer be to that?

159
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,420
What would his answer be?

160
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,640
Even if that were true,

161
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,140
even if the calculus
worked out that way,

162
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,820
even if you shouldn't throw
the Christian's to the lions

163
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,360
because in the long run
fear will spread,

164
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,440
the overall utility will decline.

165
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:19,940
The utilitarian would be
upholding justice and right

166
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,550
and respect for persons
for the wrong reason,

167
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,220
for a purely a contingent reason,

168
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:31,310
for an instrumental reason.

169
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,710
It would still be using people,

170
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,580
even where the calculus works out
for the best in the long run,

171
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,340
it would still be using
people as means

172
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:48,160
rather than respecting them
as ends in themselves.

173
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,220
So, that's Kant's idea
of freedom as autonomy

174
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:59,860
and you can begin to see how it's
connected to his idea of morality.

175
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:03,900
But we still have to answer
one more question,

176
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,270
what gives an act its moral worth
in the first place?

177
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,900
If it can't be directed,

178
00:13:12,469 --> 00:13:14,980
that utility or satisfying
wants and desires,

179
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,860
what gives an action
its moral worth?

180
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,060
This leads us from Kant's
demanding idea of freedom

181
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,820
to his demanding idea
of morality.

182
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:29,460
What does Kant say?

183
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,530
What makes an action
morally worthy

184
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,560
consists not in the consequences
or in the results that flow from it,

185
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,960
what makes an action morally worthy
has to do with the motive,

186
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:50,500
with the quality of the will,

187
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,140
with the intention for
which the act is done.

188
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,870
What matters is the motive

189
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,260
and the motive must be
of a certain kind.

190
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:07,540
So, the moral worth
of an action

191
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,370
depends on the motive
for which it's done

192
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:14,180
and the important thing
is that the person

193
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,580
do the right thing
for the right reason.

194
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,180
"A good will isn't good because of
what it affects or accomplishes,"

195
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,620
Kant writes,
"it's good in itself.

196
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:31,500
Even if by its utmost effort,
the goodwill accomplishes nothing,

197
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,000
it would still shine like a jewel
for its own sake

198
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,630
as something which has
its full value in itself."

199
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,940
And so, for any action
to be morally good,

200
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,430
it's not enough that it should conform
to the moral law,

201
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,020
it must also be done
for the sake of the moral law.

202
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:59,410
The idea is that the motive
confers the moral worth on an action

203
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:06,020
and the only kind of motive that can
confer moral worth on an action

204
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:08,180
is the motive of duty.

205
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,020
Well, what's the opposite of doing
something out of a sense of duty

206
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,380
because it's right?

207
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:16,940
Well for Kant,

208
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,620
the opposite would be
all of those motives

209
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,910
having to do
with our inclinations.

210
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,460
And inclinations refer
to all of our desires,

211
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,940
all of our contingently given wants,

212
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,200
preferences, impulses,
and the like.

213
00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:36,980
Only actions done for the sake
of the moral law,

214
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,400
for the sake of duty,

215
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:41,420
only these actions
have moral worth.

216
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,650
Now, I want to see what you think
about this idea

217
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,660
but first let's consider
a few examples.

218
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,030
Kant begins with an example
of a shopkeeper.

219
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,300
He wants to bring out
the intuition

220
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,220
and make plausible the idea

221
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,380
that what confers
moral worth on an action

222
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,970
is that it be done
because it's right.

223
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,500
He says suppose there's a shopkeeper

224
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,420
and an inexperienced customer comes in.

225
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:15,490
The shopkeeper knows that he could
give the customer the wrong change,

226
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,180
could shortchange the customer
and get away with it;

227
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,700
at least that customer wouldn't know.

228
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,620
But the shopkeeper nonetheless says,

229
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,490
"Well, if I shortchange this customer,
word may get out,

230
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:33,300
my reputation would be damaged,

231
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,010
and I would lose business,

232
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:38,240
so I won't shortchange this customer."

233
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,000
The shopkeeper does nothing wrong,

234
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:44,750
he gives the correct change,

235
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:47,730
but does his action
have moral worth?

236
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:51,360
Kant says no,
it doesn't have moral worth

237
00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:55,660
because the shopkeeper only did
the right thing for the wrong reason,

238
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,760
out of self-interest.

239
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:02,740
That's a pretty
straightforward case.

240
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:10,460
Then he takes another case,
the case of suicide.

241
00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:14,140
He says we have a duty
to preserve ourselves.

242
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:21,340
Now, for most people
who love life,

243
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,220
we have multiple reasons
for not taking our own lives.

244
00:17:29,389 --> 00:17:32,400
So, the only way
we can really tell,

245
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,860
the only way we can isolate
the operative motive

246
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,550
for someone who
doesn't take his or her life

247
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,780
is to think 每
to imagine someone who's miserable

248
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:54,680
and who despite having an
absolutely miserable life

249
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,320
nonetheless recognizes the duty
to preserve one's self

250
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,020
and so does not commit suicide.

251
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:16,060
The force of the example is to
bring out the motive that matters

252
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,280
and the motive that matters
for morality

253
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,860
is doing the right thing
for the sake of duty.

254
00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:26,540
Let me just give you
a couple of other examples.

255
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,910
The Better Business Bureau,
what's their slogan?

256
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,630
The slogan of the
Better Business Bureau:

257
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,820
"Honesty is the best policy.

258
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,750
It's also the most profitable."

259
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,680
This is the Better Business Bureau's
full page ad in the New York Times,

260
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:50,430
"Honesty, it's as important
as any other asset

261
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:54,140
because a business that deals in truth,
openness, and fair value

262
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,890
cannot help but do well.

263
00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:00,820
Come join us and profit from it."

264
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,920
What would Kant say
about the moral worth

265
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,860
of the honest dealings of members
of the Better Business Bureau?

266
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,820
What would he say?

267
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,620
That here's a perfect example
that if this is the reason

268
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:20,580
that these companies deal honestly
with their customers,

269
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:26,050
their action lacks moral worth,
this is Kant's point.

270
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,160
A couple of years ago,
at the University of Maryland,

271
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:30,910
there was a problem with cheating

272
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,560
and so they initiated
an honor system

273
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,900
and they created a program
with local merchants

274
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,390
that if you signed the honor pledge,
a pledge not to cheat,

275
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,680
you would get discounts of
10% to 25% at local shops.

276
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:57,620
Well what would you think of someone
motivated to uphold an honor code

277
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,680
with the hope of discounts?

278
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,410
It's the same as Kant's shopkeeper.

279
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,220
The point is, what matters
is the quality of the will,

280
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:10,300
the character of the motive

281
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:16,460
and the relative motive to morality
can only be the motive of duty,

282
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,740
not the motive of inclination.

283
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,380
And when I act out of duty,

284
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:29,260
when I resist as my motive
for acting inclinations

285
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,900
or self-interest,

286
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,380
even sympathy and altruism,

287
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:37,390
only then am I acting freely,

288
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,580
only then am I acting autonomously,

289
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,490
only then is my will not
determined or governed

290
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,070
by external considerations,

291
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:55,030
that's the link between Kant's
idea of freedom and of morality.

292
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:58,550
Now, I want to pause here
to see if all of this is clear

293
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,890
or if you have some
questions or puzzles.

294
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,660
They can be questions
of clarification

295
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,620
or they can be challenges.

296
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:13,620
If you want to challenge this idea
that only the motive of duty

297
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,690
confers moral worth
on the action.

298
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,680
What do you think?

299
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,540
Yes.

300
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,140
Yeah, I actually have two
questions of clarification.

301
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,820
The first is, there seems
to be an aspect of this

302
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,380
that makes it sort of
self-defeating

303
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:34,660
in that once you're conscious
of what morality is

304
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,380
you can sort of alter your motive
to achieve that end of morality.

305
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,180
Give me an example of
what you have in mind.

306
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,180
The shopkeeper example.

307
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,300
If he decides that he wants to
give the person the money

308
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,900
to do the right thing

309
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,220
and he decides that
it's his motive to do so

310
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:55,460
because he wants to be moral

311
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,580
then isn't that sort of
defeating trying to 每

312
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,350
isn't that sort of defeating
the purity of his action

313
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,340
if morality is determined
by his motive?

314
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:06,660
His motive is then
to act morally.

315
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,300
I see.
So, you're imagining a case

316
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,960
not of the purely selfish
calculating shopkeeper

317
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,100
but of one who says,

318
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,190
well, he may consider
shortchanging the customer.

319
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,390
But then he says, "Not,

320
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,790
or my reputation might suffer
if word gets out."

321
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:26,580
But instead he says,

322
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,930
"Actually, I would like to be
the kind of honest person

323
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,460
who gives the right change
to customers

324
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,100
simply because it's
the right thing to do."

325
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,740
Or simply, "Because
I want to be moral."

326
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,730
"Because I want to be moral,
I want to be a good person,

327
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,190
and so I'm going to conform
all of my actions

328
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,780
to what morality requires."

329
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,450
It's a subtle point,
it's a good question.

330
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,390
Kant does acknowledge,

331
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,500
you're pressing Kant
on an important point here,

332
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,690
Kant does say there
has to be some incentive

333
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,620
to obey the moral law,

334
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,580
it can't be a self-interested incentive

335
00:23:15,879 --> 00:23:18,020
that would defeat it by definition.

336
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:24,780
So, he speaks of a different kind
of incentive from that inclination,

337
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,340
he speaks of reverence
for the moral law.

338
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,460
So, if that shopkeeper says,

339
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,820
"I want to develop
a reverence for the moral law

340
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,820
and so I'm going to do
the right thing"

341
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,040
then I think he's there,

342
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,020
he's there as far as
Kant's concerned

343
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:50,500
because he's formed his motive,

344
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:56,420
his will is conforming
to the moral law

345
00:23:56,639 --> 00:23:58,680
once he sees the
importance of it.

346
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,830
So, it would count,
it would count.

347
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,060
All right, then, secondly,
very quickly,

348
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:09,220
what stops morality from becoming
completely objective in this point?

349
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:12,140
What stops morality
from becoming subjective?

350
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:19,020
Yeah, like how can 每 if morality
is completely determined by your morals

351
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,340
then how can you apply this
or how can it be enforced?

352
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:23,180
All right,
that's also a great question.

353
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,660
-- What's your name?
-- My name is Amady.

354
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,940
-- Amady?
-- Yes.

355
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:30,740
All right,
if acting morally

356
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:36,370
means acting according
to a moral law out of duty

357
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:43,010
and if it's also to act freely
in the sense of autonomously,

358
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,340
it must mean that I'm acting according
to a law that I give myself,

359
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:50,700
that's what it means
to act autonomously,

360
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:52,900
Amady is right about that,

361
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,940
but that does raise a
really interesting question.

362
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,820
If acting autonomously means acting
according to a law I give myself,

363
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,040
that's how I escape the chain of cause
and effect and the laws of nature.

364
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:15,580
What's the guarantee
that the law I give myself

365
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,000
when I'm acting out of duty

366
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:24,330
is the same as the law
that Amady is giving himself

367
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:32,700
and that each of you gives yourselves?

368
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,240
Well, here's the question,

369
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,260
how many moral laws,
from Kant's point of view,

370
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,820
are there in this room?

371
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,260
Are there a thousand or is there one?

372
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:49,860
He thinks there's one, which in a way
does go back to this question:

373
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,620
all right, what is the moral law?

374
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,100
What does it tell us?

375
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:00,100
So, what guarantees 每
it sounds like to act autonomously

376
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:02,460
is to act according
to one's conscience,

377
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,220
according to a law
one gives oneself,

378
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:07,140
but what guarantees
that we 每

379
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,150
if we all exercise our reason,

380
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,420
we will come up with
one and the same moral law?

381
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,300
That's what Amady wants to know.

382
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,040
Here's Kant's answer:

383
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,460
the reason that leads us
to the law we give ourselves

384
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,020
as autonomous beings is a reason,

385
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:38,170
it's a kind of practical reason
that we share as human beings.

386
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,540
It's not idiosyncratic.

387
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,500
The reason we need to
respect the dignity of persons

388
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,080
is that we're all rational beings,

389
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,850
we all have the capacity for reason

390
00:26:52,949 --> 00:26:56,060
and it's the exercise of
that capacity for reason

391
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:01,240
which exists undifferentiated
in all of us

392
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,180
that makes us worthy of dignity,
all of us,

393
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,120
and since it's the same
capacity for reason,

394
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:18,780
unqualified by particular
autobiographies and life circumstance,

395
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:21,300
it's the same universal
capacity for reason

396
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,380
that delivers the moral law,

397
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,140
it turns out that to act autonomously

398
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:31,620
is to act according to a law we give
ourselves exercising our reason,

399
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,840
but it's the reason we share
with everyone as rational beings,

400
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:41,500
not the particular reasons we have
given our upbringings,

401
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,760
our particular values,
our particular interests.

402
00:27:45,879 --> 00:27:50,010
It's pure practical reason,
in Kant's terms,

403
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:56,340
which legislates a priori regardless
of any particular contingent

404
00:27:56,899 --> 00:27:58,220
or empirical ends.

405
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:03,180
Well, what moral law would
that kind of reason deliver?

406
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:08,640
What is its content?

407
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:13,420
To answer that question,
you have to read the groundwork

408
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,900
and we'll continue with
that question next time.

409
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:32,170
For Kant, morally speaking,
suicide is on a par with murder.

410
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,460
It's on a par with murder
because what we violate

411
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,100
when we take a life,

412
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,440
when we take someone's life,
ours or somebody else's,

413
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,580
we use that person,
we use a rational being,

414
00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:50,300
be use humanity as a means

415
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,140
and so we fail to
respect humanity as an end.

416
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:04,700
Today we turn back to Kant.

417
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:10,940
Before we do,
remember this is the week

418
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:17,050
by the end of which all of you
will basically get Kant,

419
00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:18,540
figure out what he's up to.

420
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:21,220
You're laughing.

421
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,300
No, it will happen.

422
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:33,740
Kant's groundwork is
about two big questions.

423
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,300
First, what is the supreme
principle of morality?

424
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,780
Second, how is freedom possible?

425
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,740
Two big questions.

426
00:29:51,840 --> 00:30:00,940
Now, one way of making your way
through this dense philosophical book

427
00:30:02,629 --> 00:30:06,380
is to bear in mind
a set of oppositions

428
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,780
or contrasts
or dualisms

429
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,340
that are related.

430
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,980
Today I'd like to talk about them.

431
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,740
Today we're going to
answer the question,

432
00:30:20,879 --> 00:30:25,520
what, according to Kant,
is the supreme principle of morality?

433
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,940
And in answering that question,

434
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,060
in working our way up to Kant's answer
to that question

435
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:36,700
it will help
to bear in mind

436
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,180
three contrasts,
or dualisms,

437
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:44,060
that Kant sets out.

438
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,940
The first,
you'll remember,

439
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:56,140
had to do with the motive
according to which we act.

440
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,100
And according to Kant,
only one kind of motive

441
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:08,100
is consistent with morality,
the motive of duty,

442
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,460
doing the right thing
for the right reason.

443
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,860
What other kind of motives are there?

444
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:21,130
Kant sums them up in
the category of inclination.

445
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:32,600
Every time the motive for what we do
is to satisfy a desire or a preference

446
00:31:33,139 --> 00:31:35,620
that we may have,
to pursue some interest,

447
00:31:36,699 --> 00:31:38,120
we're acting out of inclination.

448
00:31:39,699 --> 00:31:44,720
Now, let me pause to see
if in thinking about the question

449
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,780
of the motive of duty,
the goodwill,

450
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,350
see if any of you has a question
about that much of Kant's claim.

451
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:55,560
Or is everybody happy
with this distinction?

452
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,260
What do you think?
Go ahead.

453
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,940
When you make that distinction
between duty and inclination

454
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:05,220
is there ever any moral action ever?

455
00:32:05,379 --> 00:32:09,220
I mean you could always, kind of,
probably find some selfish motive, can't you?

456
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,780
Maybe, very often people do have
self-interested motives when they act.

457
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,500
Kant wouldn't dispute that

458
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:28,190
but what Kant is saying is
that in so far as we act morally,

459
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,220
that is in so far as our actions
have moral worth,

460
00:32:31,969 --> 00:32:38,140
what confers moral worth
is precisely our capacity

461
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,850
to rise above self-interest
and prudence and inclination

462
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,780
and to act out of duty.

463
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,460
Some years ago I read
about a spelling bee

464
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,920
and there was a young man
who was declared the winner

465
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,770
of the spelling bee,

466
00:33:00,699 --> 00:33:02,740
a kid named Andrew,
13 years old.

467
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,580
The winning word,
the word that he was able to spell,

468
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:09,100
was "echolalia."

469
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:13,980
Does anyone know what echolalia is?
What?

470
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,860
Some type of flower?

471
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,100
It's not some type of flower.
No.

472
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:24,100
It means the tendency
to repeat as in echo,

473
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,680
to repeat what you've heard.

474
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:32,980
Anyhow, he misspelled it actually
but the judges misheard him,

475
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,420
they thought he had
spelled it correctly

476
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,690
and awarded him the championship
of the National Spelling Bee

477
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:45,980
and he went to the judges
afterward and said,

478
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,180
"Actually, I misspelled it,
I don't deserve the prize."

479
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,060
And he was regarded as a moral hero

480
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:56,110
and he was written up
in the New York Times,

481
00:33:56,719 --> 00:34:01,500
"Misspeller is Spelling Bee Hero."

482
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:08,700
There's Andrew with his proud mother

483
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,860
and when he was interviewed afterwards,
listen to this,

484
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,960
when he was interviewed afterwards,
he said,

485
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,770
"The judges said
I had a lot of integrity,"

486
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,100
but then he added
that part of his motive was,

487
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,110
"I didn't want to feel like a slime."

488
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,730
All right.
What would Kant say?

489
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,800
Go ahead.

490
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,530
I guess it would depend
on whether or not

491
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:46,580
that was a marginal reason
or the predominant reason

492
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:50,400
and whether or not 每
and why he decided to confess

493
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,020
that he didn't actually
spell the word correctly.

494
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,740
Good.
And what's your name?

495
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,780
Bosco.

496
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,280
That's very interesting.

497
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:01,110
Is there anyone else who
has a view about this?

498
00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:06,960
Does this show that Kant's principle
is too stringent, too demanding?

499
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,420
What would Kant say about this?

500
00:35:12,259 --> 00:35:13,180
Yes.

501
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:19,230
I think that Kant actually says
that it is the pure motivation

502
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,290
that comes out of duty
which gives the action moral worth.

503
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,300
So, it's like,
for example in this case,

504
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,610
he might have more than one motive,

505
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,660
he might have the motive
of not feeling like a slime

506
00:35:29,029 --> 00:35:33,420
and he might have the motive of doing
the right thing itself out of duty

507
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,540
and so, while there's more
than one motivation going on there

508
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,660
doesn't mean that the action
is devoid of moral worth

509
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:42,690
just because he has one other motive

510
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:47,380
because the motive which involves duty
is what gives it the moral worth.

511
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,150
Good.
And what's your name:

512
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,320
Judith.

513
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:54,180
Well Judith, I think that your account
actually is true to Kant.

514
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,920
It's fine to have
sentiments and feelings

515
00:35:59,509 --> 00:36:04,620
that support doing the right thing
provided they don't provide

516
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,540
the reason for acting.

517
00:36:08,759 --> 00:36:11,820
So, I think Judith actually has
mounted a pretty good defense of Kant

518
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,380
on this question of the
motive of duty.

519
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,420
Thank you.

520
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,040
Now, let's go back to
the three contrasts.

521
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,740
It's clear at least what
Kant means when he says

522
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:31,140
that for an action to have moral worth,
it must be done for the sake of duty,

523
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,500
not out of inclination.

524
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,260
But as we began to see last time,

525
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:42,050
there's a connection between
Kant's stringent notion of morality

526
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,220
and his specially demanding
understanding of freedom.

527
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,300
And that leads us to
the second contrast,

528
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:54,340
the link between
morality and freedom

529
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:59,810
The second contrast describes
two different ways

530
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,740
that my will can be determined;

531
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:05,540
autonomously
and heteronomously.

532
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:14,220
According to Kant, I'm only free
when my will is determined autonomously.

533
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,140
Which means what?

534
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,780
According to a law
that I give myself.

535
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:23,300
We must be capable, if we're
capable of freedom as autonomy,

536
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,660
we must be capable of acting
according not to a law

537
00:37:27,319 --> 00:37:28,420
that's given or imposed on us

538
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,380
but according to a law
we give ourselves.

539
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:35,500
But where could such a law
come from?

540
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:37,660
A law that we give ourselves.

541
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,860
Reason.

542
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:47,060
If reason determines my will

543
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:57,010
then the will becomes a power to choose
independent of the dictates of nature

544
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,130
or inclination or circumstance.

545
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:06,520
So, connected with Kant's demanding
notions of morality and freedom

546
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:11,230
is a specially demanding
notion of reason.

547
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:15,700
Well, how can reason
determine the will?

548
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:20,630
There are two ways and this leads
to the third contrast.

549
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,570
Kant says there are two
different commands of reason

550
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:30,300
and a command of reason
Kant calls an imperative

551
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,140
an imperative is simply an ought.

552
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:37,220
One kind of imperative,
perhaps the most familiar kind,

553
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,830
is a hypothetical imperative.

554
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:46,970
Hypothetical imperatives
use instrumental reason.

555
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:54,620
If you want x then do y.

556
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:57,410
It's means-ends reasoning.

557
00:38:58,279 --> 00:39:05,670
If you want a good business reputation
then don't shortchange your customers,

558
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,340
word may get out.

559
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,130
That's a hypothetical imperative.

560
00:39:11,509 --> 00:39:15,300
"If the action would be good
solely as a means to something else,"

561
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:17,740
Kant writes,
"the imperative is hypothetical.

562
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:21,210
If the action is represented
as good in itself

563
00:39:22,089 --> 00:39:27,540
and therefore is necessary for a will
which of itself accords with reason,

564
00:39:28,779 --> 00:39:32,020
then the imperative is categorical."

565
00:39:34,029 --> 00:39:38,290
That's the difference between
a categorical imperative

566
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,910
and a hypothetical one.

567
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:44,250
A categorical imperative
commands categorically,

568
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:50,620
which just means without reference to
or dependence on any further purpose

569
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,260
and so you see
the connection

570
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,770
among these three
parallel contrasts.

571
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:02,720
To be free,
in the sense of autonomous,

572
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:09,270
requires that I act not out of
a hypothetical imperative

573
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,860
but out of a categorical imperative.

574
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:18,160
And so you see by these three
contrasts Kant reasons his way,

575
00:40:18,259 --> 00:40:25,160
brings us up to his derivation
of the categorical imperative.

576
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:28,680
Well, this leaves us
one big question:

577
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,530
what is the categorical imperative?

578
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,260
What is the supreme
principle of morality?

579
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,960
What does it command of us?

580
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:43,000
Kant gives three versions,
three formulations,

581
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,090
of the categorical imperative.

582
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,790
I want to mention two
and then see what you think of them.

583
00:40:50,859 --> 00:40:53,580
The first version,
the first formula,

584
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:58,360
he calls the
formula of the universal law;

585
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:04,260
"Act only on that maxim whereby
you can at the same time will

586
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:07,690
that it should become
a universal law."

587
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,060
And by maxim,
what does Kant mean?

588
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:16,670
He means a rule that explains the
reason for what you're doing,

589
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,260
a principle.

590
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:21,020
For example,
promise keeping.

591
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:29,630
Suppose I need money,
I need $100 desperately

592
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,150
and I know I can't pay it back
anytime soon.

593
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:37,540
I come to you
and make you a promise,

594
00:41:37,819 --> 00:41:39,710
a false promise,
one I know I can't keep,

595
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,180
"Please give me $100 today,
lend me the money,

596
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,460
I will repay you next week."

597
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:51,180
Is that consistent with
the categorical imperative,

598
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:52,300
that false promise?

599
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,840
Kant says no.

600
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,450
And the test,
the way we can determine

601
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:02,460
that the false promise is at odds
with the categorical imperative

602
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,230
is try to universalize it,

603
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:09,290
universalize the maxim upon
which you're about to act.

604
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,060
If everybody made false promises
when they needed money

605
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,540
then nobody would believe
those promises,

606
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,660
there would be no such thing
as a promise,

607
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,860
and so there would be
a contradiction.

608
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,140
The maxim universalized
would undermine itself.

609
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:34,040
That's the test.

610
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,460
That's how we can know
that the false promise is wrong.

611
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,560
Well what about the
formula of the universal law?

612
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:49,140
You find it persuasive?

613
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,030
What do you think?
Go ahead.

614
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:01,600
I have a question about
the difference between categoricalism

615
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:06,300
and a hypothesis
that if you're going to act . . .

616
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,380
Between categorical and hypothetical.

617
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,570
Hypothetical, yeah.

618
00:43:09,759 --> 00:43:10,560
Imperatives.

619
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:15,020
Right. If you're going to act
with a categorical imperative

620
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,220
so that the maxim doesn't
undermine itself,

621
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:23,390
it sounds like I am going to
do x because I want y,

622
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:30,260
I'm going to not lie in dire need
because I want the world to function

623
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,180
in such a way that promises are kept.

624
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:35,510
I don't want to liquidate
the practice of promises.

625
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:40,970
Right, it sounds like
justifying a means by an ends.

626
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,170
It seems like an instance of
consequentialist reasoning,

627
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:46,200
you're saying.
-- Right.

628
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,100
-- And what's your name?
-- Tim.

629
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,620
Well Tim, John Stewart Mill
agreed with you.

630
00:43:57,279 --> 00:44:00,480
He made this criticism of Kant.

631
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:08,260
He said, "If I universalize the maxim
and find that the whole practice

632
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:11,070
of promise keeping would be
destroyed if universalized,

633
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:15,940
I must be appealing somehow
to consequences

634
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:21,200
if that's the reason not to tell
a false promise."

635
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:27,330
So, John Stewart Mill agreed
with that criticism against Kant

636
00:44:28,089 --> 00:44:29,500
but John Stewart Mill was wrong.

637
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,510
You're in good company though.
You're in good company, Tim.

638
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:41,240
Kant has often read,
as Tim just read him,

639
00:44:43,029 --> 00:44:45,670
as appealing to consequences.

640
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:50,500
The world would be worse off
if everybody lied

641
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:53,660
because then no one could rely
on anybody else's word

642
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,940
therefore you shouldn't lie.

643
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:59,520
That's not what Kant
is saying exactly.

644
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,440
Although, it's easy to
interpret him as saying that.

645
00:45:05,859 --> 00:45:08,760
I think what he's saying is
that this is the test,

646
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,780
this is the test of whether
the maxim corresponds

647
00:45:15,109 --> 00:45:16,450
with the categorical imperative.

648
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:20,740
It isn't exactly the reason,
it's not the reason,

649
00:45:21,879 --> 00:45:25,640
the reason you should universalize
to test your maxim

650
00:45:26,629 --> 00:45:34,840
is to see whether you are privileging
your particular needs and desires

651
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:38,240
over everybody else's.

652
00:45:38,879 --> 00:45:41,390
It's a way of pointing
to this feature,

653
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,960
this demand of the
categorical imperative

654
00:45:44,529 --> 00:45:48,740
that the reasons for your action
shouldn't depend

655
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,700
for their justification
on your interests, your needs,

656
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:58,660
your special circumstances being
more important than somebody else's.

657
00:45:59,779 --> 00:46:04,460
That, I think, is the moral intuition
lying behind the universalization test.

658
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,890
So, let me spell out the second,

659
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,340
Kant's second version of
the categorical imperative,

660
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,910
perhaps in a way that's more
intuitively accessible

661
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,820
than the formula of universal law.

662
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:24,860
It's the formula of humanity as an end.

663
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:30,590
Kant introduces the second version
of the categorical imperative

664
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:32,980
with the following line of argument:

665
00:46:34,339 --> 00:46:37,480
"We can't base the
categorical imperative

666
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,640
on any particular interests,
purposes, or ends

667
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,080
because then it would be only relative
to the person whose ends they were.

668
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:52,680
But suppose, however, there was
something whose existence has in itself

669
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:56,500
an absolute value . . .
an end in itself . . .

670
00:46:56,759 --> 00:47:00,550
then in it,
and in it alone,

671
00:47:01,009 --> 00:47:04,800
would there be the ground of a
possible categorical imperative."

672
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:10,190
Well, what is there
that we can think of

673
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,750
as having its end in itself?

674
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:18,360
Kant's answer is this,
"I say that man,

675
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,140
and in general every rational being,
exists as and end in himself,

676
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,910
not merely as a means for arbitrary use
by this or that will."

677
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,500
And here Kant distinguishes between
persons on the one hand

678
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:37,320
and things on the other.

679
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:39,540
Rational beings are persons,

680
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,900
they don't just have a
relative value for us

681
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,720
but if anything has they
have an absolute value,

682
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:52,740
an intrinsic value,
that is rational beings have dignity.

683
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,740
They're worthy of
reverence or respect.

684
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:01,050
This line of reasoning leads Kant
to the second formulation

685
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,370
of the categorical imperative
which is this:

686
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:08,520
"Act in such a way that
you always treat humanity,

687
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:13,220
whether in your own person
or in the person of any other,

688
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,040
never simply as a means,

689
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,640
but always at the same time,
as an end."

690
00:48:21,629 --> 00:48:25,810
So, that's the
formula of humanity as an end,

691
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:32,610
the idea that human beings as
rational beings are ends in themselves,

692
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:37,770
not open to use
merely as a means.

693
00:48:38,609 --> 00:48:40,700
When I make a
false promise to you,

694
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:47,880
I'm using you
as a means to my ends,

695
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:50,340
to my desire for the $100,

696
00:48:51,089 --> 00:48:55,800
and so I'm failing to respect you,

697
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,760
I'm failing to respect your dignity,

698
00:48:58,750 --> 00:48:59,770
I'm manipulating you.

699
00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:06,040
Now, consider the example
of the duty against suicide.

700
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:14,820
Murder and suicide are at odds
with the categorical imperative.

701
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,620
Why?

702
00:49:17,609 --> 00:49:22,940
If I murder someone,
I'm taking their life for some purpose,

703
00:49:23,879 --> 00:49:27,340
either because I'm a hired killer

704
00:49:28,129 --> 00:49:30,960
or I'm in the throes of
some great anger passion,

705
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,070
I have some interest,
some purpose,

706
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:39,680
that's particular for the sake
which I'm using them as a means.

707
00:49:40,359 --> 00:49:44,150
Murder violates the
categorical imperative.

708
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:50,340
For Kant, morally speaking,
suicide is on a par with murder.

709
00:49:51,069 --> 00:49:56,930
It's on a par with murder because
what we violate when we take a life,

710
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,760
when we take someone's life,
ours or somebody else's,

711
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,830
we use that person,
we use a rational being,

712
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,220
we use humanity
as a means

713
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:13,430
and so we fail to respect
humanity as an end.

714
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,970
And that capacity for reason,
that humanity that commands respect,

715
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,120
that is the ground of dignity,

716
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:26,580
that humanity,
that capacity for reason

717
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:31,780
resides undifferentiated in all of us

718
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:37,880
and so I violate that dignity in my
own person, if I commit suicide,

719
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,470
and in murder
if I take somebody else's life.

720
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,440
From a moral point of view
they're the same

721
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:50,980
and the reason they're the same
has to do with the universal character

722
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:54,340
and ground of the moral law.

723
00:50:55,540 --> 00:51:00,140
The reason that we have to respect
the dignity of other people

724
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:05,030
has not to do with anything
in particular about them

725
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:11,010
and so respect, Kantian respect,
unlike love in this way.

726
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:13,930
It's unlike sympathy.

727
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,700
It's unlike solidarity
or fellow feeling or altruism

728
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,550
because love and those
other particular virtues or reasons

729
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,780
for caring about other people have to
do with who they are in particular.

730
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,340
But respect,
for Kant,

731
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:36,090
respect is respect for humanity
which is universal,

732
00:51:36,279 --> 00:51:38,740
for a rational capacity
which is universal,

733
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:42,300
and that's why violating it,
in my own case,

734
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,770
is as objectionable as violating it
in the case of any other.

735
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,700
Questions or objections?

736
00:51:54,879 --> 00:51:56,260
Go ahead.

737
00:51:57,819 --> 00:52:05,140
I guess I'm somewhat worried
about Kant's statement

738
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,580
that you cannot
use a person as a means

739
00:52:07,799 --> 00:52:09,760
because every person
is an end of themselves,

740
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:14,040
because it seems that everyday,

741
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,550
in order to get something
accomplished for that day,

742
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:19,340
I must use myself
as a means to some end

743
00:52:20,569 --> 00:52:24,100
and I must use the people around me
as a means to some end as well.

744
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:30,030
For instance, suppose that
I want to do well in a class

745
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,490
and I have to write a paper.

746
00:52:31,879 --> 00:52:33,900
I have to use myself
as a means to write the paper.

747
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:38,130
Suppose I want to buy something,
food,

748
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:41,780
I must go to the store and use
the person working behind the counter

749
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,930
as a means for me to purchase my food.

750
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,180
Right.
That's true, you do.

751
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:48,990
What's your name?

752
00:52:49,149 --> 00:52:49,700
Patrick.

753
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,620
Patrick, you're not
doing anything wrong.

754
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:55,110
You're not violating
the categorical imperative

755
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,820
when you use other people as means,

756
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,290
that's not objectionable

757
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:04,880
provided when we deal
with other people

758
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,460
for the sake of advancing
our projects and purposes and interests,

759
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:10,440
which we all do,

760
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:16,030
provided we treat them
in a way that is consistent

761
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:19,060
with respect for their dignity

762
00:53:20,129 --> 00:53:22,590
and what it means
to respect them

763
00:53:24,359 --> 00:53:27,660
is given by the
categorical imperative.

764
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:33,220
Are you persuaded?

765
00:53:34,359 --> 00:53:39,910
Do you think that Kant
has given a compelling account,

766
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:43,640
a persuasive account,
of the supreme principle of morality?

767
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:53,280
Reread the groundwork and we'll
try to answer that question next time.
