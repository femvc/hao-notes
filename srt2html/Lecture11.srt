1
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,730
Today we turn to Kant's
reply to Aristotle.

2
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:41,930
Kant thinks that Aristotle
just made a mistake.

3
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,320
It's one thing,
Kant says,

4
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:50,090
to support a fair
framework of rights

5
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,480
within which people
can pursue their own

6
00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:54,580
conceptions of the good life.

7
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,630
It's something else and something
that runs the risk of coercion

8
00:01:02,099 --> 00:01:05,030
to base law or
principles of justice

9
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,900
on any particular conception
of the good life.

10
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:12,970
You remember Aristotle says in order
to investigate the ideal constitution

11
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,530
we have first to figure out
the best way to live.

12
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,510
Kant would reject that idea.

13
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,140
He says that constitutions
and laws and rights

14
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,520
rights should not embody
or affirm or promote

15
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,810
any particular way of life.

16
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,800
That's at odds with freedom.

17
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,850
For Aristotle the
whole point of law,

18
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:35,670
the purpose of polis

19
00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:38,930
is to shape character,

20
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,490
to cultivate the
virtue of citizens,

21
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,340
to inculcate civic excellence,
to make possible a good way of life.

22
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,020
That's what he tells
us in the politics.

23
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:50,590
For Kant, on the other hand,

24
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,870
the purpose of law, the
point of a constitution

25
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,200
is not to inculcate or
to promote virtue.

26
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,140
It's to set up a fair framework
of rights within which

27
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:10,120
citizens may be free to pursue their own
conceptions of the good for themselves.

28
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,190
So we see the difference
in their theories of justice.

29
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:18,530
We see the difference
in their account of

30
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,090
law or the role of a constitution,
the point of politics,

31
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,720
and underlying these
differences are

32
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,290
two different accounts of what
it means to be a free person.

33
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,860
For Aristotle we are free
insofar as we have

34
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,030
the capacity to realize
our potential.

35
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,550
And that leads us to
the question of fit.

36
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,460
Fit between persons and the roles
that are appropriate to them.

37
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:51,920
Figuring out what I'm cut out for.

38
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,090
That's what it means to lead a free life,
to live up to my potential.

39
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,820
Kant rejects that
idea and instead

40
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,930
substitutes his famously
demanding notion of

41
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,050
freedom as the capacity
to act autonomously.

42
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,990
Freedom means acting according
to a law I give myself.

43
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,750
Freedom is autonomy.

44
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,860
Part of the appeal,
part of the moral force

45
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,420
of the view of Kant
and of Rawls consists in

46
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,590
the conception of the person as
a free and independent self

47
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,940
capable of choosing
his or her own ends.

48
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,370
The image of the self is
free and independent

49
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:50,300
offers a, if you think about it,
a powerful liberating vision

50
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,170
because what it says is
that as free moral persons

51
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:59,420
we are not bound by
any ties of history

52
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:04,230
or of tradition or
of inherited status

53
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,440
that we haven't chosen
for ourselves,

54
00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:15,020
and so we're unbound by any moral
ties prior to our choosing them.

55
00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:21,760
And that means
that we are

56
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,270
free and independent
sovereign selves.

57
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,350
We're the authors of the only
obligations that constrain us.

58
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:41,160
The communitarian critics of
Kantian and Rawlsian liberalism

59
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,050
acknowledge that there
is something powerful

60
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,900
and inspiring in that
account of freedom,

61
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,360
the free independent
choosing self,

62
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,260
but they argue it
misses something.

63
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,580
It misses a whole dimension of
moral life and even political life.

64
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,620
It can't make sense of our moral
experience because it can't account

65
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,460
for certain moral and
political obligations

66
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,750
that we commonly recognize
and even prize.

67
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:16,040
And these include obligations
of membership, loyalty,

68
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,950
solidarity, and other moral ties
that may claim us for reasons

69
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,440
that we can't trace to
an act of consent.

70
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,680
Alistair McIntyre

71
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:38,420
gives an account what he calls a
narrative conception of the self.

72
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,110
It's a different account
of the self.

73
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:50,260
Human beings are essentially
storytelling creatures, McIntyre argues.

74
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,730
That means I can only
answer the question

75
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,470
'what am I to do?' if I can
answer the prior question

76
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,960
of what story or stories
do I find myself a part?

77
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:06,980
That's what he means by the
narrative conception of the self.

78
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,460
What does this have to do with the
idea of community and belonging?

79
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,020
McIntyre says this,

80
00:06:17,049 --> 00:06:20,580
Once you accept this narrative
aspect of moral reflection

81
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:26,070
you will notice that we can
never seek for the good

82
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,060
or exercise of the virtues
only as individuals.

83
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:36,880
We all approach our circumstance as
bearers of particular social identities.

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,990
I am someone's son
or daughter,

85
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,220
a citizen of this or that city,

86
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,790
I belonged to this plan,
that tribe, this nation.

87
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:49,430
Hence, McIntyre argues,
what is good for me

88
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:54,130
has to be the good for someone
who inhabits these roles.

89
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:59,640
I inherit from the past of my family,
my city, my tribe, my nation

90
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,660
a variety of debts, inheritances,
expectations, and obligations.

91
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:09,770
These constitute the given of my
life, my moral starting point.

92
00:07:10,549 --> 00:07:16,350
This is in part what gives my
life its moral particularity.

93
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,620
That's the narrative
conception of the self.

94
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:26,080
And it's a conception
that sees the self as

95
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:30,070
claimed or encumbered,
at least to some extent,

96
00:07:32,049 --> 00:07:33,490
by the history,
the tradition,

97
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,970
the communities,
of which it's a part.

98
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,770
We can't make sense
of our lives,

99
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,890
not only as a psychological matter,
but also as a moral matter

100
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,370
in thinking what we are to do

101
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:50,970
without attending to
these features about us.

102
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,640
Now, McIntyre recognizes
that this narrative account,

103
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,380
this picture of the
encumbered self,

104
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:07,340
puts his account at odds with
contemporary liberalism and individualism.

105
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,610
From the standpoint
of individualism

106
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,740
I am what I myself
choose to be.

107
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,250
I may biologically
be my father's son

108
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:20,310
but I can't be held responsible
for what he did

109
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:24,350
unless I choose to assume
such responsibility.

110
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:30,050
I can't be held responsible for what
my country does, or has done,

111
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,280
unless I choose to assume
such responsibility.

112
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,690
But McIntyre says this reflects a
certain kind of moral shallowness

113
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,730
even blindness.

114
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,810
It's a blindness at odds with the full
measure of responsibility which sometimes,

115
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:52,250
he says, involves collective responsibility
or responsibilities that may flow

116
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,790
from historic memories.

117
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:56,480
And he gives some examples.

118
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,400
Such individualism is expressed by
those contemporary Americans

119
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,250
who deny any responsibility for the effects
of slavery upon black Americans saying

120
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,650
"I never owned any slaves."

121
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,580
Or the young German
who believes

122
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,280
that having been born
after 1945 means

123
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,620
that what Nazis did to Jews
has no moral relevance

124
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,290
to his relationship to his
Jewish contemporaries.

125
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,930
McIntyre says all of these
attitudes of historical amnesia

126
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,700
amount to a kind of
moral abdication.

127
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,530
Once you see that
who we are

128
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:43,760
and what it means to sort
out our obligations

129
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:47,050
can't be separated,
shouldn't be separated

130
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:51,230
from the life histories
that define us.

131
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,930
The contrast, he says, with
a narrative account, is clear,

132
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,560
For the story of my life is always
embedded in the story

133
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,670
of those communities from
which I derived my identity.

134
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,390
I am born with the past and to try
to cut myself off from that past

135
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,690
is to deform my present
relationships.

136
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,940
So there you have in McIntyre,
a strong statement of the idea

137
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,300
that the self can't be detached,
shouldn't be detached,

138
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:26,920
from its particular ties
of membership history,

139
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:30,100
story narrative.

140
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,630
Now, I want to get
your reactions

141
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:37,310
to the communitarian critique

142
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,620
of the individualist
or the voluntarist,

143
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,530
the unencumbered self.

144
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,690
But let's make it concrete
so that you can react

145
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,580
to more than just the
theory of it by looking at

146
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:55,990
the two different accounts of moral
and political obligation that arise

147
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,220
depending on which of these conceptions
of the person one accepts.

148
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,650
On the liberal conception,

149
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:11,350
moral and political obligations
arise in one of two ways.

150
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,600
There are natural duties that we
owe human beings as such.

151
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,970
duties of respect for
persons qua persons.

152
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:23,470
These obligations are universal.

153
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,480
Then, as Rawls points out,

154
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,240
there are also voluntary
obligations.

155
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,810
Obligations that we owe
to particular others

156
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,270
insofar as we have agreed

157
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:43,900
whether through a promise
or a deal or a contract.

158
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:49,940
Now, the issue between the liberal and
communitarian accounts of the self,

159
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,750
is there another category
of obligation or not?

160
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:00,330
The communitarian says there is.

161
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,520
There is a third category
that might be called

162
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:06,000
obligations of solidarity or
loyalty or membership.

163
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:11,790
The communitarian argues that
construing all obligations

164
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,790
as either natural duties
or voluntary obligations

165
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:21,280
fails to capture obligations
of membership or solidarity.

166
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,830
Loyalties whose moral force
consists partly in the fact

167
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,510
that living by them
is inseparable from

168
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,040
understanding ourselves as
the particular persons we are.

169
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:36,250
What would be some examples?

170
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,260
And then I want to see how
you would react to them.

171
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:45,390
Examples of obligations
of membership

172
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:51,240
that are particular but don't
necessarily flow from consent

173
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:58,610
but rather from membership narrative
community, one situation.

174
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:03,910
The most common examples are
ones to do with the family.

175
00:13:04,849 --> 00:13:07,130
The relation between parents
and children, for example.

176
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,700
Suppose there were two
children drowning.

177
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,360
You could save only
one of them.

178
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,390
One was your child, the other
was a stranger's child.

179
00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:25,690
Would you have an
obligation to flip a coin

180
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,240
or would there be
something morally obtuse

181
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,640
if you didn't rush
to save your child?

182
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,580
Now, you may say, well,
parents have agreed

183
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,400
to have their children.

184
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,390
So take the other case,
the case of children's

185
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,070
obligation for their parents.

186
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,340
Now, we don't choose
our parents.

187
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,690
We don't even choose
to have parents.

188
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,420
There is that asymmetry.

189
00:13:50,349 --> 00:13:55,630
And yet consider two aging
parents, one of them yours,

190
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,510
the other a stranger's.

191
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:03,210
Doesn't it make moral sense to think
that you have a greater obligation

192
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,930
to look after your aged parent than to
flip a coin or to help the stranger's?

193
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,810
Now, is this traceable to consent?
Not likely

194
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,800
Or take a couple of
political examples.

195
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:26,430
During World War II,
French resistance pilots

196
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,990
flew bombing raids over
occupied France.

197
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,250
One day, one of the pilots
received his target

198
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:38,790
and noticed that the village
he was being asked to bomb

199
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,480
was his home village.

200
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:49,230
He refused, not disputing that it was as
necessary as the target he bombed yesterday.

201
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,650
He refused on the ground that
he couldn't bring himself.

202
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,310
It would be a special moral crime
for him to bomb his people

203
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:03,440
even in a cause that he supported,
the cause of liberating France.

204
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:07,020
Now, do we admire that?

205
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,310
If we do, the communitarian argues,

206
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,510
it's because we do recognize
obligations of solidarity.

207
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,510
Take another example.

208
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:21,630
Some years ago there was
a famine in Ethiopia.

209
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,200
Hundreds of thousands
of people were starving.

210
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:31,610
The Israeli government organized an
airlift to rescue Ethiopian Jews.

211
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:35,830
They didn't have the capacity to
rescue everyone in Ethiopia.

212
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,850
They rescued several
hundred Ethiopian Jews.

213
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:43,650
Now, what's your moral
assessment?

214
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:51,170
Is that a kind of morally troubling
partiality, a kind of prejudice?

215
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:59,790
Or as the Israeli government thought,
is there a special obligation of solidarity

216
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,750
that this airlift properly
responded to?

217
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,060
Well, that takes us to the
broader question of patriotism.

218
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:14,420
What, morally speaking, is
to be said for patriotism?

219
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,700
There are two towns
named Franklin.

220
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,850
One is Franklin, Texas,

221
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:23,140
and the other is just across the
Rio Grande River, Franklin, Mexico.

222
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:27,240
What is the moral significance
of national boundaries?

223
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,060
Why is it, or is it the case

224
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:34,590
that we as Americans have
a greater responsibility

225
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,170
for the health and the education
and the welfare and public provision

226
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:41,110
for people who live
in Franklin, Texas,

227
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:45,690
than equally needy people
just across the river,

228
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,330
living in Franklin, Mexico?

229
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:53,480
According to the communitarian
account, membership does matter.

230
00:16:54,930 --> 00:17:00,000
And the reason patriotism is
at least potentially a virtue

231
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,910
is that it is an expression of

232
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:06,040
the obligations of citizenship.

233
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:14,240
How many are sympathetic to the idea that
there is this third category of obligation?

234
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,160
The obligations of solidarity
or membership.

235
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,290
How many are sympathetic
to that idea?

236
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,020
And how many are
critical of that idea?

237
00:17:27,639 --> 00:17:31,720
How many think all obligations
can be accounted for

238
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,670
in the first two ways?

239
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,190
All right, let's hear from the critics
of the communitarian idea first.

240
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,080
Yes.

241
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,080
My biggest concern with the
idea of having obligations

242
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:51,000
because you're a member of
something or because of solidarity

243
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:55,670
is that it seems that if you accept
those obligations as being

244
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,610
sort of morally binding, then there is a
greater occurrence of overlapping obligations

245
00:18:00,889 --> 00:18:04,500
a greater occurrence
of good versus good.

246
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,730
And I don't know if
this sort of framework

247
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,710
allows us to choose
between them.

248
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,040
Good, and what's your name?
- Patrick.

249
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:21,170
So you worry that if we recognize
obligations of membership or solidarity,

250
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:26,100
since we inhabit different communities,
their claims might conflict,

251
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:30,170
and what would we do if we
have competing obligations?

252
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,930
Yes.

253
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:39,610
Well, one solution is that we
could view ourselves as

254
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:44,020
ultimately, members of
the human community

255
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,960
and that then within that we have
all these smaller spheres, of that,

256
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,330
you know, I am American or
I am a student at Harvard.

257
00:18:52,770 --> 00:19:00,510
and so the most important
community to be obligated to

258
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:04,140
is the community
of human beings.

259
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,240
And then from there you
can sort of, evaluate,

260
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,750
which other ones are
most important to you.

261
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,990
So the most, and what's your name?
- Nichola.

262
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,170
So, Nichola, you say the
most universal community

263
00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:19,130
we inhabit, the community
of human kind,

264
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,870
always takes precedence?	
- Yes.

265
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,550
Patrick, are you satisfied?

266
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,730
No.
- Why not?

267
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,250
It seems rather arbitrary that
we should choose the

268
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,150
universal obligation over the
more specific obligation.

269
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:41,230
I might also say that I should be obligated
first to the most specific of my obligations.

270
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,230
For instance, take my family
as a small unit of solidarity.

271
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,800
Perhaps I should be first
obligated to that unit

272
00:19:49,379 --> 00:19:51,320
and then perhaps to
the unit of my town,

273
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,640
and then my country, and
then the human race.

274
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,020
Good, thank you.

275
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,730
I want to hear from another critic
of the communitarian view.

276
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,430
We have the objection, well,
what if goods collide?

277
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,720
Who objects to the
whole idea of it?

278
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,710
Who sees patriotism as just
the kind of prejudice

279
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:11,290
that ideally we should overcome?

280
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,890
Yes.

281
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,050
Patriotism reflects a
community membership.

282
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:22,430
That's a, like, a given.

283
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:30,730
I think the problem is that where some
memberships are natural narratives,

284
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:37,100
the narrative of citizenship
is a constructed one.

285
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:43,610
And I think a false one because, as
the river is just a historical accident,

286
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,850
it makes no sense that because
the lottery of birth threw me into

287
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,060
the United States as
opposed to Mexico that

288
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,330
that's the membership that
I should be a part of.

289
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,190
Good. And what's your name?
- Elizabeth.

290
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,220
Elizabeth.
Who has a reply?

291
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,150
Yes.

292
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,160
I think in general, we have to ask where
do our moral obligations arise from anyway.

293
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:09,420
And I think, basically, there'd be two
places from which they could arise.

294
00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:12,630
One would be kin and the other
one would be reciprocity.

295
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,230
And isn't the closer you are
associated to other people,

296
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,300
there's a natural reciprocity
there in terms of

297
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,060
having interactions
with those people.

298
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:25,910
You interact with the
neighbors on your street,

299
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,570
with the other people in your country
through economic arrangements-

300
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:32,040
But I don't know and you don't know
those people in Franklin, Texas,

301
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:35,330
any more than you know the people
in Franklin, Mexico, do you?

302
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:38,310
Presumably you're naturally more
connected with the people

303
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:41,290
in your own country in terms
of interaction and trade

304
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,730
than you are with people
in other countries.

305
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,600
Good. Who else?
Go ahead.

306
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:51,040
Yeah, I think that a lot of
the basis for patriotism

307
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:54,980
can be compared to like school spirit
or even house spirit that we see here

308
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:59,210
where freshmen are sorted into houses
and then within a day they have developed

309
00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:02,630
some sort of attachment or a
pride associated with that house.

310
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:05,950
And so I think that we can
probably draw a distinction between

311
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:09,010
a moral obligation for
communitarian beliefs

312
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,300
and sort of just a sentimental,
emotional attachment.

313
00:22:12,629 --> 00:22:14,330
Good. Wait, stay there.
What's your name?

314
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,510
Rina.

315
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,740
What about... Go back to my
example about the obligation

316
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,540
of the child to the parent.

317
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:22,610
Would you say the
same thing there?

318
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:26,560
It just may or may not be a sentimental
type and it has no moral weight?

319
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,060
Well, I mean, I'm not entirely certain
that accident, in the initial stages,

320
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,460
something that will preclude
moral obligations later.

321
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:41,890
Just because we are randomly
sorted into a house or just because

322
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:45,500
we don't choose who our parents
are or what country we're born into

323
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:50,490
doesn't necessarily mean that we won't
develop an obligation based on

324
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,960
some type of benefit,
I guess, to sort of...

325
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,170
So your obligation to
your aged parent

326
00:22:57,399 --> 00:23:01,610
that's greater than to aged
parents around the world,

327
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:08,640
is only because and insofar
as you're repaying a benefit

328
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,830
that your parent gave you
when you were growing up?

329
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,160
Yeah, I mean, I would say that if
you look at cases of adoption where,

330
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,050
you have a biological parent somewhere
else that you don't interact with,

331
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,250
and then you have a parent
who adopted you,

332
00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:25,490
most people would say that if
you had to pick between them

333
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:29,610
in the case of aging parents,
that your obligation would lie

334
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:34,790
more with the person who raised you and
who had exchanges with you meaningfully.

335
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,060
May I ask you one more
question about the parent?

336
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,080
Sure.

337
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:42,620
Do you think that a person with
a bad parent owes them less?

338
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,080
I don't know because I've
never had a bad parent.

339
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:55,070
I think that's a good place to end.
- Thank you.

340
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,390
We'll continue with this
next time. Thank you.

341
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:05,090
If I were working on an [economics]
problem set, for example,

342
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,710
and I saw that my
roommate was cheating,

343
00:24:08,639 --> 00:24:12,250
that might be a bad thing for him
to do but I wouldn't turn him in.

344
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,790
You would not turn him in.

345
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,950
I wouldn't turn him in and I think that
I would argue that's the right thing to do

346
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:18,880
because of my obligation to him.

347
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,390
You don't have a duty
to tell the truth,

348
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,450
to report someone
who cheated?

349
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:31,470
Today I'd like to take,
I'd like to consider

350
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,630
the strongest objections
to the idea that there are

351
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,860
obligations of solidarity
or membership.

352
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:43,000
Then I want to see if those objections
can be met successfully.

353
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,100
One objection emerged in
the discussion last time.

354
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,170
Patrick said,

355
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:54,700
if obligations flow from community
membership and identity,

356
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:56,790
we inhabit multiple
communities,

357
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,300
doesn't that mean that our
obligations will sometimes conflict?

358
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,790
So that's one possible objection.

359
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:14,790
And then Rina said these examples
meant to bring out the moral force

360
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,650
of solidarity and membership,

361
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:26,070
examples about parents and children,
about the French resistant fighter

362
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:29,050
asked to bomb his own village
and withdrawing back.

363
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,990
About the airlift by Israel
of the Ethiopian Jews.

364
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,820
These examples, they maybe
intuitively evocative, Rina said.

365
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:42,530
But really they're pointing to matters
of emotion, matters of sentiment.

366
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,870
Not true moral obligations.

367
00:25:47,899 --> 00:25:51,140
And then there were a
number of objections,

368
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:55,750
not necessarily to
patriotism as such.

369
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:04,520
But to patriotism understood as an
obligation of solidarity and membership

370
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,500
beyond consent.

371
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:16,430
This objection allowed that there can be
obligations to the communities we inhabit

372
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,770
including obligations
to patriotism.

373
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,130
But this objection argued that all
of the obligations of patriotism,

374
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,900
or of community
or membership,

375
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:34,480
are actually based on liberal ideas
and perfectly compatible with them.

376
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:39,920
Consent, either implicit
or explicit or reciprocity.

377
00:26:42,629 --> 00:26:44,700
Julia Ratthel for example
on the web site

378
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:52,830
said that liberalism can endorse patriotism
as a voluntary moral obligation.

379
00:26:53,629 --> 00:26:57,760
Patriotism and familial love
both fall into this category

380
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,320
because after all,
Julia points out,

381
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:05,550
the Kantian framework allows people
free reign to choose to express

382
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,440
virtues such as these
if they want to.

383
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,890
So you don't need the idea of a
non-voluntary particular moral obligation

384
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:20,430
to capture the moral force
of community values.

385
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,260
Where is Julia?

386
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,620
Okay, so did I summarize
that fairly?

387
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:34,540
Julia actually is in line with what
Rawls says about this very topic.

388
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,230
You weren't aware of that?

389
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,070
You came up it within your own.
That's pretty good.

390
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:44,860
Rawls says, when he's discussing
political obligation,

391
00:27:45,689 --> 00:27:48,720
he says it's one thing if
someone runs for office

392
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,130
or enlists in the military,

393
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,800
they are making a
voluntary choice.

394
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,580
But Rawls says there is, I believe, no
political obligations, strictly speaking,

395
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,620
for a citizens generally.

396
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:03,480
Because it's not clear what is
the requisite binding action

397
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,280
and who has performed it.

398
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:11,080
So Rawls acknowledges
that for ordinary citizens

399
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:18,530
there is no political obligation
except in so far as

400
00:28:18,939 --> 00:28:22,940
some particular citizen willingly,
through an act of consent,

401
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:27,310
undertakes or chooses
such an obligation.

402
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,630
That's in line with Julia's point.

403
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:36,550
It's related to another objection
that people have raised which is

404
00:28:37,439 --> 00:28:40,870
it's perfectly possible to recognize
particular obligations

405
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:44,150
to ones family or to
ones country, provided

406
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,680
honoring those obligations
doesn't require you

407
00:28:47,939 --> 00:28:52,620
to violate any of the natural
duties or requirements

408
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,600
of the universal respect for
persons-qua-persons.

409
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:59,950
So that's consistent with the idea
that we can choose if we want to,

410
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:04,920
to express our loyalty to our country
or to our people or to our family

411
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,900
provided we don't
do any injustice

412
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,850
within the framework acknowledging the
priority that is of the universal duties.

413
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,930
The one objection that
I didn't mention is

414
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,260
the view of those who say

415
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,280
that obligations of membership really
are kind of collective selfishness,

416
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:25,950
why should we honor them?

417
00:29:26,889 --> 00:29:28,540
Isn't it just the kind of prejudice?

418
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,530
So what I'd like to do,
perhaps of those of you

419
00:29:32,629 --> 00:29:36,530
who have agreed, who wrote
and who have agreed

420
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:39,640
to press these objections,

421
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,750
perhaps if you could gather
down all together,

422
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,410
we'll form a team as
we did once before.

423
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:52,080
And we'll see if you can respond to
those who want to defend patriotism

424
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,310
conceived as a communal
obligation.

425
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,250
Now there were a
number of people

426
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,470
who argued in defense
of patriotism

427
00:30:06,699 --> 00:30:10,910
as the communitarian
view conceives it.

428
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,340
So let me go down now
and join the critics,

429
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,910
the critics of communitarianism.

430
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:20,160
If there's a microphone that
we could use somewhere.

431
00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:21,590
Okay, thanks Kate.

432
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:28,330
Who as the critics of patriotism,
communal patriotism

433
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,000
gather their forces here?

434
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,890
Patrick if you want to you
can join as well or Rina.

435
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:37,580
Others who have spoken or
addressed this question

436
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,020
are free to join in.

437
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:42,490
But I would like to hear
now, from those you who

438
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,090
defend patriotism
and defend it as

439
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:53,410
a moral obligation that can't
be translated back into

440
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,670
purely consent based terms.

441
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:01,170
Can't be translated
into the liberal terms.

442
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:03,040
Where is AJ Kumar?

443
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:08,590
AJ, everybody seems
to know you.

444
00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:11,460
All right, let's hear from AJ.

445
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,290
You said, in the same way I feel I owe more
to my family than to the general community,

446
00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:19,550
I owe more to my country
than to humanity in general.

447
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,270
Because my country holds a
great stake in my identity.

448
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,190
It is not prejudice for
me to love my country

449
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:30,790
unless it is prejudice for
me to love my parents

450
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,520
more than somebody else's.

451
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,020
So AJ what would you
say to this group?

452
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,690
Stand up.

453
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,130
I think that there is some
fundamental, a moral obligation

454
00:31:41,389 --> 00:31:43,690
that comes from a
communitarian responsibility

455
00:31:43,899 --> 00:31:46,570
to people in groups that
form their identity.

456
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:49,180
I mean even, like I'll give
the example that,

457
00:31:49,459 --> 00:31:51,870
there are a lot of things about
our government, right now,

458
00:31:51,969 --> 00:31:55,030
that I'm not in favor of
but part of my identity is

459
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,090
that America values a free
society where we can

460
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,880
object to certain things
and I think that's an

461
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,400
expression of patriotism as well.

462
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,680
And, I go back to the parent
example, even at Harvard,

463
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:11,040
I think, I owe more to my roommates
because they make up my identity,

464
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,840
than I do it to the Harvard
community as a whole.

465
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,190
And I think that applies to our country
because there's certain things

466
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,020
that growing up here,
yes, we can't choose it,

467
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,640
we can't choose our
parents, things like that.

468
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,780
But it makes up part
of our identity.

469
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:25,960
Okay, who would like
to take that on? Mike?

470
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:32,410
Yeah about the obligation to the others
simply by virtue of being in their,

471
00:32:32,689 --> 00:32:35,100
being influenced by them.

472
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:39,150
I'm a German citizen and if
I've been born 80 years earlier

473
00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:42,150
then I would have been a
citizen of Nazi Germany.

474
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:46,490
And for some reason I just don't think
that I would have to feel obligated

475
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:52,890
towards Germany because I had
benefited from actions of Nazis.

476
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,450
I mean I guess my response
to that would be

477
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,920
you have hundreds of thousands of
protesters in the United States right now

478
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:01,380
who hold up signs that
say, "Peace is patriotic."

479
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:03,810
And I'm sure there are people in this
room who don't agree with that.

480
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,030
I personally do and
I would say that

481
00:33:06,129 --> 00:33:10,100
they are strongly objecting to basically
everything the Bush administration is

482
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,820
doing right now but they
still consider themselves

483
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:15,820
loving their country because
they're furthering the cause of

484
00:33:15,929 --> 00:33:17,210
what they see is best
for the country.

485
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,410
And I tend to agree with that
as a patriotic movement.

486
00:33:19,659 --> 00:33:23,640
Well but how's that then, how
do you still favor your country?

487
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,260
How's that still patriotic?

488
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,150
I mean isn't that more
sentimental attachment?

489
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,910
Where is the obligation there?

490
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,810
Rina?

491
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,140
Yeah not to bring this
back to John Locke, but

492
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,170
I would like to bring this
back to John Locke.

493
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:42,550
So, I mean in his conception
of, when people join society,

494
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,950
there's still some outlet.

495
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:47,330
If you're not satisfied
with your society,

496
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,200
you do have a means
of exit even though

497
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:52,240
we had a lot of concerns
about how you're born

498
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,800
and it's not very feasible,
he still provides that option.

499
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,260
If we want to say that your
obligation to society is a moral one,

500
00:33:59,449 --> 00:34:03,450
that means that prior to knowing exactly
what that society is going to be like

501
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,590
or what your position is
going to be in that society,

502
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:09,850
that means that you have a binding
obligation to a complete unknown body

503
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:14,310
that could be, completely foreign
to all of your personal beliefs

504
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:16,580
Or what you would
hold to be correct.

505
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,990
Do you think that that kind of
communal obligation or patriotism

506
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:23,690
means writing the community
a blank moral check?

507
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,550
Basically, yeah.

508
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:31,300
I think it's reasonable to say that
as you grow and as you develop

509
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,340
within the community that you acquire
some type of obligation based on reciprocity

510
00:34:35,549 --> 00:34:40,360
but to say that you have a moral obligation
I think requires a stronger justification.

511
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,030
Who else?

512
00:34:42,259 --> 00:34:43,330
Anyone else who would
like to address that?

513
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,460
I guess we could say you could argue
that you are morally obliged to society

514
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,370
by the fact that there
is that reciprocity.

515
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:52,400
I think it's the idea that, you know, we
participate in society, we pay our taxes,

516
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:56,110
we vote, this is why we could say
that we owe something to society.

517
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:59,090
But beyond that I don't think
there's anything inherent in the fact

518
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,910
that we are members of the society
itself that we owe at anything.

519
00:35:02,009 --> 00:35:05,380
I think it's in so far as we, as
the society give us something,

520
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:07,530
gives us protection,
safety, security,

521
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:11,390
then we owe the society something but
nothing beyond what we give the society.

522
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,790
Who want to take that on?

523
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,100
Raul?

524
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:23,360
I don't think we give the community
a blank moral check in that sense.

525
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:28,660
I think we only give it a blank moral
check when we abdicate our sense of

526
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,080
civic responsibility and
when we say that

527
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:34,030
the debate does matter
because patriotism is a vice.

528
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:38,800
I think that patriotism is important
because it gives us a sense of community,

529
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:42,210
a sense of common civic virtue
that we can engage in the issues.

530
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:46,210
Even if you don't agree with the
way the government is acting,

531
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,210
you can still love your country
and hate the way it's acting.

532
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,820
And I think because out
of that love of county,

533
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,840
you can debate with other people
and have respect for their views

534
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,770
but still engage
them in debate.

535
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:05,770
If you just say that, patriotism is a
vice, you drop out of that debate

536
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,150
and you cede the ground to people
who are more fundamentalist,

537
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:12,960
who have a stronger view and
who may coerce the community.

538
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,640
Instead we should engage the
other members of the community

539
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:18,990
on that same moral ground.

540
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:25,080
Now this, what we hear from AJ and Raul
that's very pluralistic argumentative

541
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:28,010
critically minded patriotism.

542
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:33,390
Whereas what we hear from, Ike
and the critics of patriotism here

543
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:40,960
is the worry that to take patriotic
obligation in a communal way, seriously,

544
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:47,460
involves the kind of loyalty that doesn't
let us just pick and choose among the beliefs

545
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:51,280
or actions or practices
of our country.

546
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:56,470
what's left of loyalty if
we're all talking about,

547
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,430
AJ and Raul,

548
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,890
if all we're talking about is
loyalty to principles of justice

549
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:08,230
that may happen to be
embodied in our community

550
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:09,750
or not as the case may be.

551
00:37:10,009 --> 00:37:13,280
And if not then we
can reject its course.

552
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,940
I don't know, I sort
of given a reply.

553
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,080
I got carried away. I'm sorry.
Who would like...?

554
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,360
Go ahead Julia.

555
00:37:20,589 --> 00:37:23,830
Yeah I think that patriotism you
need to define what that is.

556
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,640
It sounds like, you would normally think
that we are given a more weak definition

557
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,570
here of patriotism amongst
us but almost sounds like

558
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,210
your definition is merely to have some
sort civic involvement in debating

559
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,330
within your society.

560
00:37:34,609 --> 00:37:38,320
and I think that that kind of undermines
maybe some of the moral worth of patriotism

561
00:37:38,609 --> 00:37:39,820
as a virtue as well.

562
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,510
I think if you can consent to a stronger
form of patriotism if you want

563
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:47,000
that's a stronger, I guess, moral obligation
than even what you're suggesting.

564
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:55,040
What we really need to sharpen the
issue is an example from the defenders

565
00:37:55,279 --> 00:38:02,470
of communitarianism of a case where
loyalty can actually compete with

566
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:08,240
and possibly outway universal
principles of justice.

567
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,830
That's the test they really
need to meet isn't it?

568
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,420
All right. So that's the
test you need to meet.

569
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:22,450
Or, any among you who would like to defend
obligations of membership or solidarity

570
00:38:22,569 --> 00:38:28,480
independent of ones that happened
to embody just principles.

571
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:32,820
Who has an example
of a kind of loyalty

572
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,660
that can and should
compete with

573
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,090
universal moral claim
respect for persons?

574
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,450
Go ahead.

575
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:48,230
Yeah, if I were working on an
[economics] problem set, for example

576
00:38:48,799 --> 00:38:54,080
and I saw that my roommate was cheating,
that might be a bad thing for him to do

577
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,880
I wouldn't turn him in.
- You would not turn him in?

578
00:38:57,109 --> 00:39:00,170
I wouldn't turn him in and I think that
I would argue that's the right thing to do

579
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,790
because of my obligation to him.

580
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,350
It may be wrong but
that's what I would do

581
00:39:04,529 --> 00:39:06,490
and, I think that's what most
people would do as well.

582
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,760
All right, that's...
Now there's a fair test.

583
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,670
He's not slipping out by saying he's
invoking, in the name of community,

584
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,810
some universal principles of justice.

585
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:17,070
What's your name?

586
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,920
Stay there.
What's your name?

587
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,050
It's Dan.

588
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:24,540
Dan. So what do people
think about Dan's case?

589
00:39:25,009 --> 00:39:28,360
That's a harder case for the
ethic of loyalty, isn't it?

590
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,160
But a truer test.

591
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,270
How many agree with Dan?

592
00:39:37,779 --> 00:39:41,910
So loyalty... Dan loyalty
has its part, if that's it.

593
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:46,010
How many disagree with Dan?

594
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:52,290
Peggy.

595
00:39:53,529 --> 00:39:57,370
Oh well I agree with Dan but I agree
that it's a choice that we make

596
00:39:57,609 --> 00:39:59,710
but it's not necessarily
right or wrong.

597
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:02,100
I'm agreeing that I'm going
to make the wrong choice

598
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,010
because I'm going to
choose my roommate.

599
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,680
But I also recognize that
that choice isn't morally right.

600
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:11,710
So you're still translating,
even Dan's loyalty,

601
00:40:11,819 --> 00:40:13,970
you're saying well that's
a matter of choice,

602
00:40:14,299 --> 00:40:17,670
but what's the right thing to do?

603
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,730
Most people put up
their hands saying

604
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:25,850
Dan would be right to stand by his
roommate and not turn him in.

605
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,080
Yes, go ahead.

606
00:40:33,549 --> 00:40:36,850
Also I think as a roommate you
have insider information

607
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,880
and that might not be
something you want to use.

608
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:42,930
That might be something
unfair to hold against.

609
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,570
You're spending that much
time with the roommate,

610
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,260
obviously you're going to
learn things about him

611
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,660
and I don't think it's fair to reveal
that to a greater community.

612
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,700
But it's loyalty, Vojtech.

613
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:58,930
You agree with Dan that loyalty
is the ethic at stake here?

614
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,250
Absolutely.

615
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:04,670
You don't have a duty to tell the truth,
to report someone who cheated?

616
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:10,460
Not if you've been advantage into
getting that kind of information.

617
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:15,110
Before our critics of
patriotism leave,

618
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:21,150
I want to give you another version,
a more public example of what,

619
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,480
I guess we should call
it Dan's dilemma.

620
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,730
Dan's dilemma of loyalty and I want
to get the reaction of people to this.

621
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,470
This came up a few years
ago in Massachusetts.

622
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:34,500
Does anyone know
who this man is?

623
00:41:36,819 --> 00:41:39,880
Billy Bulger that's right.
Who is Billy Bulger?

624
00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:42,990
He was president of the Massachusetts
State Senate for many years.

625
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,790
One of the most powerful
politicians in Massachusetts

626
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:49,000
and then he became president of
the Univeristy of Massachusetts.

627
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:56,460
Now Billy Bulger, did you hear the story
about him that bears on Dan's dilemma?

628
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:01,490
Billy Bulger has a brother
named Whitey Bulger

629
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,090
and this is Whitey Bulger.

630
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:12,670
His brother Whitey is on the
FBI's most wanted list

631
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:18,570
alleged to be a notorious
gang leader in Boston,

632
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:24,180
responsible for many murders
and now a fugitive from justice.

633
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:32,130
But when the US attorney...
They called Billy Bulger,

634
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:36,130
then the president of the
Univeristy of Massachusetts,

635
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:39,230
before the grand jury
and wanted information

636
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:42,340
on the whereabouts of his
brother, this fugitive,

637
00:42:42,589 --> 00:42:45,830
and he refused to give it.

638
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:51,220
US attorney said,
"Just to be clear Mr. Bulger,

639
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:54,380
you feel more loyalty to your
brother than to the people

640
00:42:54,509 --> 00:42:56,190
of the commonwealth
of Massachusetts?"

641
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:58,670
And here's what
Billy Bulger said,

642
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,760
"I never thought
of it that way

643
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,990
but I do have a loyalty to my
brother, I care about him.

644
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,680
I hope that I'm never helpful
to anyone against him.

645
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:12,870
I don't have an obligation to
help anyone catch my brother."

646
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,270
Dan you would agree.

647
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:21,730
How many would agree with
the position of Billy Bulger?

648
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:28,710
Let me give one other example and
then we'll let the critics reply,

649
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,000
the critics of loyalty
as we'll describe it.

650
00:43:32,799 --> 00:43:38,080
Here's an even more fateful example
from a figure in American history,

651
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:40,880
Robert E. Lee.

652
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,660
Now Robert E. Lee on the
eve of the civil war,

653
00:43:45,759 --> 00:43:47,620
was an officer of
the Union Army.

654
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,270
He opposed secession, in fact,
regarded as treason.

655
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:57,470
When war loomed,
Lincoln offered Lee

656
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:00,050
to be the commanding
general of the Union Army,

657
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,850
and Lee refused.

658
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:08,360
And he described in a letter
to his sons why he refused.

659
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,030
With all my devotion to
the Union, he wrote,

660
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,770
I have not been able
to make up my mind

661
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,710
to raise my hand against my
relatives, my children, my home.

662
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,590
By which he meant Virginia.

663
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:24,810
If the union is dissolved I shall
return to my native state

664
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,220
and share the miseries
of my people.

665
00:44:27,549 --> 00:44:31,920
Save in her defense, I will
draw my sword no more.

666
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,950
Now here's a
real test, Dan,

667
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,210
for your principle of loyalty.

668
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,950
Because here is the cause
of the war against,

669
00:44:45,339 --> 00:44:47,800
not only to save the union
but against slavery.

670
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:53,190
And Lee is going to fight for Virginia
even though he doesn't share

671
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,450
the desire of the southern
states to secede.

672
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:02,880
Now the communitarian would say
there is something admirable in that.

673
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,140
Whether or not the decision
was ultimately right,

674
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,940
there's something admirable.

675
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,480
And the communitarian would say
we can't even make sense, Rina,

676
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,160
we can't make sense

677
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:18,500
of Lee's dilemma
as a moral dilemma

678
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,970
unless we acknowledge
that the claim of loyalty

679
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:25,550
arising from his sense of
narrative of who he is

680
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:30,280
is a moral, not just
sentimental, emotional tug.

681
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:35,030
All right, who would like to
respond to Dan's loyalty,

682
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:40,280
to Billy Bulger's loyalty or to
Robert E. Lee's loyalty to Virginia?

683
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,720
What do you say Julia?

684
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:44,600
Okay, well I think that these
are some classic examples

685
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:46,730
of multiple spheres of influence.

686
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:50,110
And that you have conflicting communities
that your family and your country.

687
00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:54,330
I think that's one reason why the idea
of choice in your obligation is so important

688
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:57,210
because how else can
you resolve this?

689
00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:00,110
If you're morally obligated and
there's no way out of this

690
00:46:00,339 --> 00:46:02,460
need for loyalty to the
both communities,

691
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,940
you're trapped, there's
nothing you can do.

692
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,220
You have to make a choice.

693
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:10,930
And I think that being able to choose
based on other characteristics,

694
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:14,320
than merely the arbitrary fact that you're
a member of this community is important,

695
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,540
otherwise it's left to,
I guess, randomness.

696
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:21,730
Well, Julia, the issue isn't whether
Dan makes a choice,

697
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:25,440
or Billy Bulger or Robert E. Lee,
of course they make a choice.

698
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:29,970
The question is on what grounds, on
what principle should they choose?

699
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,890
The communitarian doesn't deny
that there is choice to be made.

700
00:46:33,069 --> 00:46:36,230
The question is which choice,
on what grounds

701
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:41,750
and should loyalty,
as such, weigh.

702
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:45,900
Andre now you want to, all right,
go ahead. What do you say?

703
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:49,550
Well one of the things we've noticed
in the three examples is that

704
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:53,840
the people of all chosen the most immediate
community of which they're a part.

705
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,230
The more local one.

706
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,080
And I think there's something
to be said for that.

707
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,570
It's not just random.

708
00:46:58,799 --> 00:47:00,970
I mean, there doesn't
seem to be a conflict

709
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:03,250
because they know which
one is more important.

710
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,400
And it's their family
over the Ec10 Class.

711
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,620
Their state over
their country,

712
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:12,260
and their family over the
Commonwealth on Massachusetts.

713
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:16,360
So I think that's the answer
to which is more important.

714
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,520
Do you think that the local,
the more particular,

715
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:22,470
is always the weightier
morally, Andre?

716
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,000
Well I mean there's seems to be
a trend in the three cases.

717
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,570
I would agree with that.

718
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:30,670
And I think most of us would agree that
your family takes precedence over

719
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:33,860
the United States perhaps.

720
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:37,020
Which is why you go with Dan?

721
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:42,330
Loyalty to the roommate
over Ec10 and the truth?

722
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,360
Yeah, exactly.

723
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:47,710
I would because it...

724
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:51,240
I mean truth telling,
not the truth of Ec10.

725
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,110
Yes.
- Alright, so we understand.

726
00:47:56,379 --> 00:47:57,460
Yes.

727
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:00,040
But on the same example
in terms of family,

728
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,940
you had cases in the civil war where
brother was pitted against brother

729
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:06,780
on both sides of the war, where they
chose country instead of family.

730
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,940
So I think the exact same, more
shows, that different people

731
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,210
have different means of
making these choices

732
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:15,240
and that there is no one set of
values, or one set of morality

733
00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:17,460
that communitarians
can stick to.

734
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:20,020
And personally, I think that's the
biggest problem with communitarians,

735
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,970
that we don't have one set
of standard moral obligations.

736
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:26,580
And tell me your name.
- Samantha.

737
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:30,420
So Samantha, you
agree with Patrick.

738
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:31,860
Patrick's point the other day

739
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:34,930
that there may be...
If we allow obligations

740
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:39,190
to be defined by community,
identification or membership,

741
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:44,440
they may conflict, they may
overlap, they may compete.

742
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,480
And there is no clear principle.

743
00:48:48,069 --> 00:48:51,080
Andre says here's a clear principle,
the most particular.

744
00:48:51,549 --> 00:48:54,720
The other day, Nichola who was
sitting over here, where's Nichola?

745
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,750
Said that most universal.

746
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,600
You're saying, Samantha,

747
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:05,870
the scale of the community as such
can't be the decisive moral factor.

748
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:10,070
So there has to be some
other moral judgment.

749
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:15,660
All right, let's first...
Let's let our defe...

750
00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:17,980
our critics of communal
patriotism,

751
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:21,100
let's express our appreciation
and thank them

752
00:49:21,379 --> 00:49:25,460
for their having stood up and
responded to these arguments.

753
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:32,200
Let's turn to the
implications for justice

754
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:36,030
of the positions that we've
heard discussed here.

755
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:45,100
One of the worries underlying
these multiple objections

756
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:51,180
to the idea of loyalty or membership
as having independent moral weight

757
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:57,030
is that it seems to argue
that there is no way

758
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:01,950
of finding principles of justice
that are detached from

759
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:05,300
conceptions of the good life

760
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,650
as they may be lived in any
particular community.

761
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,200
Supposed the communitarian
argument is right.

762
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:18,380
Suppose the priority of the right
over the good can't be sustained.

763
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:24,450
Suppose instead, that justice
and rights unavoidably

764
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:28,410
are bound up with
conceptions of the good.

765
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:35,390
Does that mean that
justice is simply

766
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:38,360
a creature of convention,

767
00:50:38,649 --> 00:50:44,110
of the values that happen to prevail in any
given community at any given time?

768
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:50,670
One of the writings we have
among the communitarian critics

769
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:53,170
is by Michael Walzer.

770
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:57,950
He draws the implications
of justice this way.

771
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:01,640
Justice is relative to
social meanings.

772
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:07,490
A given society is just if its substantive
life is lived in a certain way,

773
00:51:07,799 --> 00:51:13,240
in a way that is faithful to the shared
understandings of the members.

774
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:18,750
So Walzer's account
seems to bear out

775
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:25,250
the worry that if we can't find
independent principles of justice,

776
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:31,050
independent that is, from conceptions of the
good that prevail in any given community,

777
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:37,920
that we're simply left with justice being
a matter of fidelity or faithfulness

778
00:51:38,779 --> 00:51:42,310
to the shared understandings
or values or conventions

779
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:45,550
that prevail in any given
society at any given time.

780
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:55,110
But is that an adequate way
of thinking about justice?

781
00:52:00,509 --> 00:52:05,970
Well, let's take a
look at a short clip

782
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:08,770
from the documentary
"Eyes on the Prize."

783
00:52:09,109 --> 00:52:12,070
It goes back in the
1950s in the south.

784
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:19,170
Here are some situated
American Southerners

785
00:52:21,049 --> 00:52:25,630
who believed in the tradition and the
shared understandings of segregation.

786
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:30,970
Listen to the arguments they
make about loyalty and tradition

787
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:36,130
And see if they don't
make you uneasy

788
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:41,840
about tying arguments about justice to
the shared understandings or traditions

789
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:46,520
that prevail in any given society
at the moment. Let's run the clip.

790
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:52,790
'This land is composed of two
different appearances.

791
00:52:53,649 --> 00:52:56,010
A white culture and
a colored culture.

792
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:59,160
And I've lived close
to them all my life.

793
00:52:59,859 --> 00:53:02,820
But I'm told now that
we've mistreated them

794
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,680
and that we must change.

795
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:08,250
And these changes are coming
faster than I expected.

796
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:12,610
And I'm required
to make decisions

797
00:53:12,819 --> 00:53:19,040
on the basis of a new way
of thinking and it's difficult.

798
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:23,530
It's difficult for me, it's
difficult for all southerners.'

799
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:31,160
Well there you have it, narrative selves,
situated selves invoking tradition.

800
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:37,540
Doesn't that show us that
justice can't be tied

801
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:41,560
to the shared understandings of goods
that prevail in any given community

802
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,150
at any given time?

803
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:48,770
Or is there a way of rescuing
that claim from this example?

804
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,380
Think about that question and
we'll return to it next time.
