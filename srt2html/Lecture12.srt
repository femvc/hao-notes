1
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,270
We ended last time talking about
the narrative conception of the self.

2
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:39,790
We were testing the narrative
conception of the self

3
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,500
and the idea of obligations
of solidarity or membership

4
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,900
that did not flow
from consent,

5
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:55,930
that claimed us for reasons unrelated
to a contract or an agreement

6
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,390
or a choice we
may have made.

7
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,130
And we were debating
among ourselves

8
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,770
whether there are any
obligations of this kind

9
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:09,460
or whether all apparent obligations
of solidarity and membership

10
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:15,080
can be translated into
consent or reciprocity

11
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,550
or universal duty that we
owe persons qua persons.

12
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,200
And then there were those who defended
the idea of loyalty and of patriotism.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,790
So the idea of loyalty and of
solidarity and of membership

14
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,350
gathered a certain kind of

15
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,980
intuitive moral force
in our discussion.

16
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:42,510
And then, as
we concluded,

17
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:48,470
we considered what seems to be a pretty
powerful counter example to that idea.

18
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:56,400
Namely, the film of those southern
segregationists in the 1950s.

19
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,180
And they talked all
about their traditions,

20
00:02:01,809 --> 00:02:04,820
their history, the way in which
their identities were bound up

21
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,770
with their life history.
Do you remember that?

22
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,960
And what flowed from that history,
from that narrative sense of identity

23
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,950
for those southern
segregationists?

24
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,610
They said we have to
defend our way of life.

25
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,410
Is this a fatal or a decisive
objection to the idea

26
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,790
of the narrative
conception of the self?

27
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,820
That's the question
we were left with.

28
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,940
What I would like to do today

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,930
is to advance an argument
and see what you make of it.

30
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,030
And let me tell you
what that argument is.

31
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,590
I would like to defend

32
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,980
the narrative conception
of the person

33
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,960
as against the voluntarist
conception.

34
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,500
I would like to defend

35
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,870
the idea that there are obligations
of solidarity or membership.

36
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,010
Then, I want to suggest

37
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,510
that there being
such obligations

38
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,790
lends force to the idea,
when we turn to justice,

39
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:17,360
that arguments about
justice can't be detached,

40
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,270
cannot be detached after all,
from questions of the good.

41
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,450
But I wanted to distinguish
two different ways

42
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,680
in which justice might
be tied to the good

43
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,110
and argue for one of them.

44
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:37,710
Now, the voluntarist conception
of the person of Kant and Rawls

45
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:40,160
we saw was powerful
and liberating.

46
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:43,870
A further appeal is its
universal aspiration.

47
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,880
The idea of treating
persons as persons

48
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,300
without prejudice,
without discrimination,

49
00:03:56,329 --> 00:04:01,430
and I think that's what led
some among us to argue that,

50
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,530
okay, maybe there are obligations of
membership but they are always subordinate.

51
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,250
They must always
be subordinate

52
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,230
to the duties that we have to human
beings as such, the universal duties.

53
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,710
But is that right?

54
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,260
If our encompassing loyalty
should always take precedence

55
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,820
over more particular ones,

56
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:30,140
then the distinction between
friends and strangers

57
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,700
should ideally be overcome.

58
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,720
A special concern for the welfare of
friends would be a kind of prejudice,

59
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:41,320
a measure of our distance
from universal human concern

60
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:46,720
But if you look
closely at that idea,

61
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,870
what kind of a moral universe,
what kind of moral imagination,

62
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,830
would that lead you to?

63
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,290
The enlightenment flows
from Montesquieu

64
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,280
gives perhaps the most
powerful, and I think,

65
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:05,710
the ultimately, the
most honest account

66
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,880
of where this relentless
universalizing tendency

67
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,500
leads the moral imagination.

68
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,310
Here's how Montesquieu put it.

69
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:20,940
He said, "A truly virtuous
man would come to the aid

70
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,780
of the most distant stranger as
quickly as to his own friend."

71
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,530
And then he adds,
listen to this,

72
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:32,960
"If men were perfectly virtuous,
they wouldn't have friends."

73
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:38,260
But it's difficult to
imagine a world

74
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,130
in which persons were so virtuous
that they had no friends,

75
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,850
only a universal disposition
to friendliness.

76
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:50,390
The problem isn't simply
that such a world

77
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,930
would be difficult to bring
about, that it's unrealistic.

78
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,850
The deeper problem
is that such a world

79
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,190
would be difficult to recognize
as a human world.

80
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,750
The love of humanity
is a noble sentiment

81
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:11,180
but most of the time we live
our lives by smaller solidarities.

82
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,190
This may reflect certain limits to
the bounds of moral sympathy,

83
00:06:17,049 --> 00:06:20,760
but more important,
it reflects the fact

84
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,600
that we learn to love
humanity, not in general,

85
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,820
but through its
particular expressions.

86
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:32,290
So these are some
considerations.

87
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:35,290
They're not knock-down arguments,

88
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,400
but moral philosophy can't offer
knock-down arguments,

89
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,170
but considerations, of the
kinds that we've been

90
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:47,940
discussing and arguing
about all along.

91
00:06:48,109 --> 00:06:50,150
Well, suppose that's right.

92
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,190
One way of assessing whether
this picture of the person

93
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:55,220
and of obligation
is right, is to see

94
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:58,980
what are its consequences
for justice.

95
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,650
And here is where is
confronts a serious problem,

96
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:06,160
and here we go back to our
southern segregationists.

97
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,140
They felt the weight
of history.

98
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,240
Do we admire their character,
these segregationists,

99
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:15,520
who wanted to preserve
their way of life?

100
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,390
Are we committed
to saying,

101
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,230
if we accept the idea of
solidarity and membership,

102
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:23,830
are we committed
to saying

103
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,460
that justice is tied to good in
the sense that justice means

104
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,110
whatever a particular community
or tradition says it means,

105
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,940
including those southern
segregationists.

106
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,040
Here it's important to
distinguish two different ways

107
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,740
in which justice can
be tied to the good.

108
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,060
One is a relativist way.

109
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,470
That's the way
that says,

110
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,410
to think about rights,
to think about justice,

111
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:01,680
look to the values that
happened to prevail

112
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:04,260
in any given community
at any given time.

113
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,100
Don't judge them by
some outside standard,

114
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:15,360
but instead conceive justice as a matter of
being faithful to the shared understandings

115
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:17,790
of a particular tradition.

116
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,410
But there's a problem with this
way of tying justice to the good.

117
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:27,820
The problem is that it makes
justice wholly conventional.

118
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:31,610
A product of circumstance,

119
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,480
and this deprives justice
of its critical character.

120
00:08:36,939 --> 00:08:39,900
But there is a second
way in which

121
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,660
justice can be tied with or
bound up with the good.

122
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,090
On a second non-relativist way of linking
justice with conceptions of the good,

123
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,810
principles of justice depend for their
justification not on the values

124
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,500
that happened to prevail at any
given moment in a certain place,

125
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:04,730
but instead on the moral worth or the
intrinsic good of the ends rights serve.

126
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,710
On this non-relativist view the
case for recognizing a right

127
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,550
depends on showing that it

128
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,210
honors or advances some
important human good.

129
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,320
The second way of tying
justice to the good

130
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,430
is not strictly speaking,
communitarian,

131
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,490
if by communitarian
you mean,

132
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,200
just giving over to a particular
community the definition of justice.

133
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,860
Now, what I would
like to suggest

134
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,620
that of these two different ways
of linking justice to the good,

135
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:43,950
the first is insufficient.

136
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,960
Because the first leaves justice
the creature of convention.

137
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,370
It doesn't give us enough

138
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:55,960
moral resources to respond to
those southern segregationists

139
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,470
who invoke their way
of life, their traditions,

140
00:09:58,569 --> 00:10:00,140
their way of doing things.

141
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,860
But if justice is bound up with
the good in a non-relativist way,

142
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,230
there is a big challenge,
a big question to answer.

143
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,380
How can we reason
about the good?

144
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:24,150
What about the fact that people hold
different conceptions of the good?

145
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,460
Different ideas about the purposes
of key social institutions.

146
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:33,160
Different ideas about what
social goods and human goods

147
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,670
are worthy of honor
and recognition.

148
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:40,210
We live in a pluralist society,
people disagree about the good.

149
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,980
That's one of the incentives to
try to find principles of justice

150
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,990
and rights that don't depend

151
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:49,980
on any particular ends
or purposes or goods.

152
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,770
So is there a way to
reason about the good?

153
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,840
Before addressing
that question,

154
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:02,000
I want to address a
slightly easier question.

155
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:07,540
Is it necessary, is it unavoidable,
when arguing about justice

156
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,050
to argue about the good?

157
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,520
And my answer to that question
is yes, it's unavoidable.

158
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,960
It's necessary.

159
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:18,430
So for the remainder of today,
I want to take up...

160
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,780
I want to try to
advance that claim,

161
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:26,790
that reasoning about the good,
about purposes, and ends,

162
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,290
is an unavoidable feature
of arguing about justice,

163
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,780
it's necessary.

164
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,550
Let me see if I can
establish that.

165
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:40,080
And for that I'd like for us to begin
a discussion of same sex marriage.

166
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,990
Now, same sex marriage
draws on, implicateds,

167
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,900
deeply contested and
controversial ideas,

168
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:55,080
morally and religiously.

169
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,790
And so there's a
powerful incentive

170
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:03,910
to embrace a conception
of justice or of rights

171
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,930
that doesn't require the society
as a whole to pass judgment,

172
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:09,290
one way or another,

173
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,910
on those hotly contested moral
and religious questions.

174
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,250
About the moral permissibility
of homosexuality.

175
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,220
About the proper ends of
marriage as a social institution.

176
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,320
So, clearly, if there's an incentive
to resolve this question,

177
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:31,630
to define people's rights in a way that
doesn't require the society as a whole

178
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,500
to sort out those moral
and religious disputes

179
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,160
that would be very attractive.

180
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,120
So what I would like
to do now is to see,

181
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,830
using the same sex
marriage case,

182
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:47,190
whether it's possible
to detach one's use

183
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,570
about the moral permissibility
of homosexuality and about

184
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:54,530
the purpose, the
end of marriage,

185
00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:58,740
detach those questions
from the question of

186
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,610
whether the state should recognize
same sex marriage or not.

187
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,120
So let's begin.

188
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:09,110
I would like to begin by hearing
the arguments of those

189
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,950
who believe that there should
be no same sex marriage

190
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:17,360
but that the state should only recognize
marriage between a man and a woman.

191
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,350
Do I have volunteers?
I had two.

192
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,720
There were two
people I asked,

193
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:26,850
people who had voiced their views
already on the justice blog.

194
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,060
Mark Loff and Ryan McCaffrey
where are you?

195
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,820
Okay, Mark.
And where is Ryan?

196
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,140
Alright, let's
go first to Mark.

197
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:40,270
I have sort of a theological
understanding of

198
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:44,590
the purpose of sex and
the purpose of marriage.

199
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:52,160
And I think that for people like myself,
who are a a Christian and also a Catholic,

200
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:59,530
the purpose of sex is, one,
for its procreative uses,

201
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,470
and two, for a unifying purpose
between a man and a woman

202
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:07,810
within the institution of marriage.

203
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,390
You have a certain conception of
the purpose or the telos... - Yeah.

204
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:16,250
...of human sexuality, which is
bound up with procreation.

205
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:17,320
Right.

206
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,270
As well as union.
- Yeah.

207
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:23,770
And the essence of marriage, the purpose
of marriage as a social institution

208
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,000
is to give expression
to that telos

209
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:33,020
and to honor that purpose, namely,
the procreative purpose of marriage.

210
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,770
Is that a fair summary of your view?
- Yeah.

211
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:38,810
Where is Ryan?
Go ahead.

212
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,080
Do you agree more or less
with Mark's reasons?

213
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,470
Yes, I agree.

214
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:50,940
I think that the ideal of
marriage involves procreation.

215
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:57,780
And it's fine that, homosexuals would
go off and cohabitate with each other

216
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,180
but the government doesn't have
a responsibility to encourage that.

217
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:03,950
All right, so the government
should not encourage

218
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:09,540
homosexual behavior by conferring
the recognition of marriage.

219
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:15,180
Yeah, it would be wrong to outlaw it
but encouraging it is not necessary.

220
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:16,650
Who has a reply?

221
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,100
Yes.

222
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,860
Hannah?

223
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,060
I just like to ask a
question to Mark.

224
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,850
Let's say you got
married to a woman,

225
00:15:30,979 --> 00:15:32,890
you did not have sex with
her before marriage,

226
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:35,770
and then when you became
married it became evident that

227
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:37,540
you're an infertile couple.

228
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,050
Do you think that it should illegal
for you to engage in sex

229
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,100
if children will not result
from that act?

230
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:48,670
Yeah, I think that it is moral and that's
why I gave the two-fold purpose.

231
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,630
So like a woman, say...

232
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:52,430
I think older couples
can get married,

233
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:54,030
someone... a woman
who's beyond...

234
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,880
she has already had menopause
and who can't have a child,

235
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:02,200
because I think that
sex has these...

236
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:05,330
It has purposes
beyond procreation.

237
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,070
I hate to be uncouth but have you
ever engaged in masturbation?

238
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:14,320
You don't have
to answer that.

239
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:20,540
Right, make your...

240
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,850
I'd like to respond to that.

241
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:33,490
Wait. We've done pretty
well over a whole semester

242
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,260
and we're doing pretty
well now dealing with

243
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,200
questions that most people think can't even
be discussed to any university settting

244
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:45,280
and, Hannah, you've got,
you have a powerful point.

245
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,380
Make that point as a general
argument rather than,

246
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,650
Rather than as an
interrogative.

247
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:53,320
Okay.
- But make the point.

248
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:55,640
What's the principle
that you're appealing?

249
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,950
What's the argument
you have in mind?

250
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,460
Alrightt. Well, biblically...
- Put it in the third person.

251
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:00,660
Yeah, okay.
- Rather than...

252
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:05,940
...Rather than in a second person.
Make the argument.

253
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:11,240
Okay. Biblically, masturbation
or onanism, is not permissible

254
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,210
because it's spilling your
seed on the earth

255
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,730
when it's not going to result
in the birth of a child.

256
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,800
But what I'm saying is,
you're saying that sex,

257
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:24,330
there's something wrong with sex
if it doesn't produce children

258
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,670
or reinforce the marriage bond.
- Right.

259
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,470
But then how can you say that
there's something wrong,

260
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:33,940
that masturbation is permissible,
if masturbation, obviously,

261
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,370
is not going to
create a child?

262
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:42,870
I think marriage is society's way
to create a separate institution

263
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,010
where they say this is
what we hold as a virtue.

264
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,370
Yes, every day we fall short
and people fall short

265
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,640
in so many different other ways,

266
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,160
but I think that if you
personally fall short,

267
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,890
and some morals fear,
as we all do,

268
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,070
that doesn't take the right
of you to argue.

269
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,570
All right, I want
you, to stay there.

270
00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:05,080
I want to bring in some other
voices and we'll continue.

271
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,540
Stay there if you would.
Go ahead.

272
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:11,560
I think that the response
to the masturbation-

273
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:12,870
Wait, tell us your name.
- My name's Steve.

274
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,930
Steve, go ahead.

275
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:16,620
The response to the
masturbation issue is,

276
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,060
it's not something
that's permissible.

277
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,210
I don't think anyone will argue that
homosexual sex is impermissible.

278
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,640
It's just that society has no place
in letting you marry yourself

279
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,680
if masturbation is
something that you do.

280
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,220
Well, all right, Hannah.

281
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,560
Alright, Steve has drawn...
Alright, that's a good argument.

282
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:42,050
Steve has drawn our attention to the
fact that there are two issues here.

283
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:45,470
One of them is the moral
permissibility of various practices.

284
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,650
The other is the fit between
certain practices,

285
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,920
whatever their moral
permissibility,

286
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,420
with the honor
or recognition

287
00:18:55,879 --> 00:18:58,420
that the state should accord
in allowing marriage.

288
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,520
So Steve has a pretty good
counter argument.

289
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,200
What do you say to Steve?

290
00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:08,400
Well, I think that it's clear
that human sexuality

291
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,370
is something that is inherent
in, I believe, most people

292
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,810
and it's not something
you can avoid.

293
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:17,280
And masturbation, I mean,
yeah, you can't marry yourself

294
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,900
but I don't think that takes
away from the fact that

295
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,160
homosexuals are people too.

296
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,320
And I can't understand why they
wouldn't be able to marry each other.

297
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,040
If you want to
marry yourself,

298
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:32,040
I mean, I don't know if
you can legally do that.

299
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:36,830
That's fine but I don't think-
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

300
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,400
Now, here we're deciding,
here we're deliberating

301
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,190
as if legislators, what
the law should be.

302
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,070
So you said, Steve, that's fine.

303
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,570
Does that mean as a
legislator you would vote

304
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:52,860
for a law of marriage that
would be so broad

305
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,880
that it would let people
marry themselves?

306
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,350
Well, I mean, that's really
beyond the pale of

307
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,670
anything that would
really happen but

308
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:05,660
I don't think that-
- But in principle.

309
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,200
Yeah, in principle?
- Yes.

310
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:09,240
Yeah, sure, I mean if Steve
wants to marry himself

311
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,680
I'm not going
to stop him.

312
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:16,260
And you would confer state
recognition on that solo marriage?

313
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:18,410
Sure.

314
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:21,280
And while we're at it,

315
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,520
what about consensual
polygamous marriages?

316
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,390
I actually think that if
the male and the female,

317
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,910
or that if the wives and the man,
of the husbands and the wife

318
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,820
are consenting, it should
be permissible.

319
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:36,330
Who else? I know there are
a lot of people who...

320
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,050
Yes, okay, down here.

321
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,440
Stand up and tell
us your name.

322
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:41,160
Victoria.
- Victoria.

323
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,670
So we're talking about the theological
reasoning here for marriage

324
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:50,040
but I think the problem is that we're talking
about it within the Catholic viewpoint.

325
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,520
Whereas, the theological,
and the point to marriage

326
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,210
for another religion or
someone who's an atheist

327
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,620
could be completely different.

328
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,260
And the government doesn't
have a right to impose

329
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:06,290
the theological reasoning for Catholicism
on everyone in the state.

330
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,730
Which is what my problem is with
not allowing same sex marriage.

331
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,340
Because, I mean, you're beliefs
are your beliefs, and that's fine,

332
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:18,180
but civil union is not marriage
within the Catholic Church.

333
00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:21,700
And the state has a right to
recognize a civil union between

334
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,390
whoever it wants, but
does not have a right

335
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,700
to impose the beliefs of a certain
minority or majority of whoever it is

336
00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:33,170
based on religion
within our state.

337
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:35,320
Alright, Victoria, good.
A question.

338
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,790
Do you think the state should
recognize same sex marriage

339
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:43,850
or just same sex civil unions as
something short of marriage?

340
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:49,860
Well, I think that the state doesn't
have a right to recognize it

341
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,700
as marriage within a church,
because that is not their place.

342
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:59,090
But whereas civil union, I see civil union
as essentially the same thing except

343
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:03,550
not under a religion and that state
has a right to recognize a civil union.

344
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,420
Alright, so, Victoria's argument is
that the state should not try to

345
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,210
decide the question of what
the telos of marriage is.

346
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,600
That's only something that
religious communities can decide.

347
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:18,310
Who else?

348
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:24,320
My point is I don't see
why you feel like

349
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,560
the state should recognize
marriages at all.

350
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,190
I'm like one of the 70
people who voted

351
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,060
that the state should not
recognize any marriages

352
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:38,850
because I believe it is a union
between male and a female

353
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,170
or two males or
two females.

354
00:22:41,629 --> 00:22:47,010
But there's no reason to ask the state to
give permission to me to unite myself.

355
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:51,250
And some might say that, if the
state recognizes these marriages,

356
00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:56,160
it will help children, it will
have a binding effect.

357
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,510
But in reality, I don't think it
actually has a binding effect.

358
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,330
Alright, tell us your name.
- Cezanne.

359
00:23:01,639 --> 00:23:04,440
So, Victoria and
Cezanne's comments

360
00:23:06,939 --> 00:23:09,350
differ from earlier parts
of the conversation.

361
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,650
They say

362
00:23:11,649 --> 00:23:13,460
the state shouldn't
be in the business

363
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,690
of honoring or recognizing
or affirming

364
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,400
any particular telos, or
purpose of marriage,

365
00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:22,070
or of human sexuality.

366
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,100
And Cezanne is among
those who says,

367
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,510
therefore, maybe the state
should get out of the business

368
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,460
of recognizing
marriage at all.

369
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,490
Here's the question.

370
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,600
Unless, you adopt
Cezanne's position,

371
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,280
no state recognition of
any kind of marriage,

372
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:39,790
is it possible to choose between...

373
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,340
...to decide the question
of same sex marriage

374
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,280
without taking a stand on the
moral and religious controversy

375
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,120
over the proper telos
of marriage.

376
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:55,010
Thank you very much to all of
you who have participated.

377
00:23:55,139 --> 00:23:57,650
We'll pick this up next time.
You did a great job.

378
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:07,970
When we first came together
some 13 weeks ago

379
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,170
I tried to warn you that once
the familiar turns strange

380
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,340
once we begin to reflect
on our circumstance,

381
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:20,690
it's never quite the same again.

382
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:26,630
I hope you have by now experienced
at least a little of this unease

383
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,380
because this is the tension that
animates critical reflection

384
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:33,780
and political improvement

385
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,940
and maybe even the
moral life as well.

386
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,630
We have two remaining
questions to answer.

387
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:50,790
First, is it necessary,
is it unavoidable

388
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:55,520
to take up questions of the good
life in thinking about justice? Yes.

389
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,480
And is it possible to
reason about justice?

390
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,750
Yes, I think so.

391
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:11,320
Let me try to develop those
answers to those two questions.

392
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:16,770
Now, as a way of addressing those
questions, we began last time

393
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,280
to discuss the question
of same sex marriage.

394
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,870
And we heard from those who
argued against same sex marriage

395
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:31,700
on the grounds that the
purpose, or telos, or marriage

396
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,200
is at least in part,
procreation,

397
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:40,790
the bearing and
raising of children.

398
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,760
And then there were those who
defended same sex marriage

399
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:54,790
and they contested that account of
the purpose, or telos, of marriage

400
00:25:55,570 --> 00:26:02,310
arguing we don't require as a
condition of heterosexual marriage

401
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:09,540
that couples be able or
willing to procreate.

402
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,330
We allow infertile
couples to marry.

403
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,200
This was Hannah's point in
the exchange with Mark.

404
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,280
Then there was
another position

405
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,740
expressed at the end our
discussion by Victoria,

406
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:32,110
who argued we shouldn't
try to decide this question.

407
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:38,020
We shouldn't, at least at the level
of the state, at the level of law,

408
00:26:39,689 --> 00:26:44,240
try to come to any agreement on
those questions about the good

409
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,720
because we live in a pluralist society
where people had different

410
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,070
moral and religious convictions.

411
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,260
And so we should
try to make law

412
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,590
in the framework
of rights, neutral

413
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:03,690
with respect to these competing
moral and religious views.

414
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,050
Now, it's interesting that
others, some others,

415
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,950
who favor the idea
of neutrality

416
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:20,360
argued, not in favor of restricting
marriage to a man and a woman,

417
00:27:20,699 --> 00:27:23,890
nor in favor of permitting
same sex marriage,

418
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,000
they argued in the
name of neutrality,

419
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:29,870
for a third possibility.

420
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:33,970
Which is that government
get out of the business

421
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:36,480
of recognizing any
kind of marriage.

422
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,380
That was the third possibility.

423
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:47,000
Now, Andrea Mayrose had an interesting
contribution to this debate.

424
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,770
She had a rejoinder to people
who argue for neutrality.

425
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,280
Where is Andrea?

426
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,180
Alright, Andrea, would
you be willing...

427
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:00,200
Share with us the view.
If we can get you a microphone.

428
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:04,250
Share with us your view.

429
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:09,890
Why do you think
that it's a mistake

430
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,630
for the state to
try to be neutral

431
00:28:13,129 --> 00:28:16,370
moral and even religious questions
like same sex marriage?

432
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,630
I don't know that it is possible
because people's lives are

433
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:24,490
completely embedded in
how they view the world.

434
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:27,490
And maybe I just agree
with Aristotle that

435
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,630
the role of the government is
helping people live in a sort of...

436
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:36,740
Having a collective understanding
what is wrong and what is right.

437
00:28:37,209 --> 00:28:40,190
Is it possible, and one could ask
the same question of abortion,

438
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,960
that we've been asking
of same sex marriage.

439
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,210
Do you think it's possible

440
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,820
to decide whether
abortion should be

441
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,090
permitted or prohibited

442
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:55,190
without taking a stand
or making a judgment

443
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,370
about the moral permissibility
of abortion?

444
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,120
No, I don't think it is and I think
that's why it's such a controversy

445
00:29:01,379 --> 00:29:03,680
because people are so
deeply committed to,

446
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:08,380
their fundamental beliefs about
whether a fetus is a life or if it isn't.

447
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:14,650
If I believe that, a fetus is a
living being and has rights

448
00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:17,420
and has fundamentally
the right to live,

449
00:29:17,699 --> 00:29:18,830
then it's very hard
for me to say,

450
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,360
"But I can put that aside and
let you do what you want,"

451
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,910
because that's
like me saying,

452
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:26,720
"well, despite my beliefs, I'm going to
let you commit what to me is murder."

453
00:29:26,949 --> 00:29:29,640
So, I mean, that's just one...

454
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:33,270
Alright, and the analogy in the
same sex marriage case is,

455
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,160
you said, you're a defender
of same sex marriage. - Yes.

456
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:40,090
But you only came
to that view

457
00:29:40,689 --> 00:29:42,730
once you were persuaded

458
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,130
on the underlying
moral question.

459
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,500
Right, well, I think
particularly, in the US

460
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,250
so many people's beliefs are
driven by their religious beliefs

461
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:55,220
and like Mark the other day,
I'm a Christian, I'm Catholic,

462
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:58,560
and I had to decide for myself
on a lot of thought,

463
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,300
a lot of prayer, a lot of
conversations with other people

464
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,630
that I disagreed with
the Catholic standpoint

465
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,530
that homosexuality
itself isn't a sin.

466
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:10,000
And once I came to that, sort of conclusion,
in my personal relationship with god,

467
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:13,470
I mean, that's sounds hokey, right?
That's like, oh, religious!

468
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,280
But a lot of people are religious
and that's where they draw

469
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,750
theif beliefs and
their views from.

470
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:20,340
That's when I could say, yeah,
I'm down with the state saying,

471
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,490
"Go same sex marriage!"

472
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:25,730
because I'm okay with that
and I think that's morally okay.

473
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,950
Good, thank you.

474
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,430
Now, who would
like to reply?

475
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:34,300
If you can, perhaps, hang
on there for a moment.

476
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:38,690
Who would like to reply
to Andrea's idea

477
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,550
that in order to decide the
question of same sex marriage,

478
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:47,460
it's necessary to sort out
the question about the

479
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:50,370
moral status of
homosexuality

480
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:56,870
and figuring out the purpose, the
telos, the proper end, of marriage?

481
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:01,420
Who disagrees with
Andrea on that point?

482
00:31:03,649 --> 00:31:04,570
Yes.

483
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,050
Well, I think you absolutely can
separate your moral opinion

484
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,420
and what you think
the law should be.

485
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:13,960
For example, I
think abortion is

486
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:16,880
unequivocally morally wrong.

487
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,710
But I do not believe that illegalizing
abortion makes it go away.

488
00:31:21,209 --> 00:31:23,410
I don't believe illegalizing
abortion stops it.

489
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:27,330
And, therefore, I am pro choice and I do
believe the woman should have the choice

490
00:31:27,689 --> 00:31:29,730
as it gives it more
safety just as,

491
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,600
maybe, morally, I don't want
to get married to a man,

492
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,640
but I'm not going try to,

493
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:42,920
impede someone else's freedom to do
what they wish to do in terms of the law.

494
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,190
Andrea?

495
00:31:45,449 --> 00:31:48,120
Whether the law makes
something legal or illegal,

496
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:52,170
it's implicitly approving or
disapproving something.

497
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:57,470
So if you say, by making abortion
legal, we're saying it's okay.

498
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:02,330
As a society, collectively, we're saying
it's okay with us in our society

499
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,340
to abort a fetus.

500
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:09,720
If we make it illegal, then we're
saying collectively as a society

501
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,490
it's not okay, and that's why
societies have different beliefs.

502
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,110
Tell us your name before you...
- My name is Daniel.

503
00:32:14,209 --> 00:32:15,550
Daniel, what do you say?

504
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,680
Are we saying collectively
that it's okay?

505
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,550
Or are we saying that
collectively we don't

506
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,740
want women who are going to
have an aboration anyway

507
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,880
to go to clinics in
the side alleys

508
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,550
and have unsafe conditions?

509
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,370
Alright, bring it to the
same sex marriage case.

510
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:31,720
Why don't you have to decide that
which position you're in favor of

511
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,690
same sex marriage, Daniel,
being legally permitted?

512
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:36,180
I think it absolutely should
be legally permitted

513
00:32:36,469 --> 00:32:38,750
because it's not something
telling me that I need to have...

514
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,260
I need to marry a man.

515
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,230
I absolutely don't, I don't see,
if two men are consenting adults

516
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,950
and want to get married, I don't
see how I could even object to that.

517
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:48,830
Alright, there's no harm.
There's no harm done.

518
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:49,870
There's no harm
done either way,

519
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,850
even if it is morally wrong
according to me.

520
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:58,510
Alright, let me turn to the way
the Massachusetts court,

521
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,260
who made this landmark ruling
in the same sex marriage case,

522
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:05,130
grappled with the very issue
that Andrea and Dan had been

523
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:08,920
discussing here.
Thanks to both of you very much.

524
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,280
What did the court say?

525
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:12,730
This was in the Goodridge
case which

526
00:33:12,929 --> 00:33:15,600
required the state
of Massachusetts

527
00:33:15,699 --> 00:33:20,770
to extend marriage
to same sex couples.

528
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:26,860
The court started out, well,
the court was conflicted.

529
00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:30,340
If you read that opinion carefully,
the court was conflicted

530
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:36,010
as between the two positions
we've just been hearing,

531
00:33:36,939 --> 00:33:39,170
defended by Andrea
and by Dan.

532
00:33:40,129 --> 00:33:44,260
The court begins, and this is
Chief Justice Margaret Marshall's opinion,

533
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:48,670
it begins with an attempt
at liberal neutrality.

534
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:52,540
Many people hold deep-seated
religious, moral and ethical convictions

535
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,960
that marriage should be limited to the
union of one man and one woman,

536
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,650
and that homosexual
conduct is immoral.

537
00:33:59,139 --> 00:34:02,750
Many hold equally strong religous,
moral, and ehtical convictions

538
00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:05,630
that same sex souples are
entitled to be married,

539
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,500
that homosexual persons should
be treated no differently

540
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,430
than their heterosexual neighbors.
This is the court.

541
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,140
Neither view answers
the question before us.

542
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:22,580
What is at stake is "respect for individual
autonomy and equality under law."

543
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:27,600
At stake is an individual freely
choosing the person with whom

544
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,160
to share an exclusive
commitment.

545
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,600
In other words, the issue is not
the moral worth of the choice

546
00:34:34,799 --> 00:34:37,260
but the right of the
individual to make it.

547
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:43,550
So this is the liberal neutral
strand in the court opinion,

548
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,610
voluntarist strand, the one
that emphasizes autonomy,

549
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,690
choice, consent.

550
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:56,390
But the court seemed to realize
that the liberal case,

551
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:01,820
the neutral case, for recognizing
same sex marriage doesn't succeed,

552
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,010
doesn't get you all the
way to that position,

553
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:07,770
because if it were only a matter of
respect for individual autonomy,

554
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:13,330
if government were truly
neutral on the moral worth

555
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:16,360
of voluntary intimate
relationships,

556
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,880
then it should adopt
a different policy.

557
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:27,050
Which is to remove government
and the state all together

558
00:35:27,279 --> 00:35:32,740
from according recognition
to certain associations,

559
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:36,090
certain kinds of unions,
rather than others.

560
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,620
If government really
must be neutral,

561
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:45,100
then the consistent
position is what we here

562
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,980
have been describing
as the third position,

563
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,640
the one defended in the
article by Michael Kinsley,

564
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:55,000
who argues for the
abolition of marriage,

565
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,910
at least as a state function.

566
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:01,480
Perhaps a better term for this is
the disestablishment of religion.

567
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,640
This is Kinsley's proposal.

568
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:11,330
He points out that the reason for the
opposition to same sex marriage

569
00:36:12,549 --> 00:36:15,900
is that it would go beyond
neutral toleration

570
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:19,610
and give same sex marriage a
government stamp of approval.

571
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,700
That's at the heart
of the dispute.

572
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:25,770
In Aristotle's terms,
at issue here

573
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:29,410
is the proper distribution
of offices and honors,

574
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,210
a matter of social recognition.

575
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,750
Same sex marriage
can't be justified

576
00:36:36,009 --> 00:36:40,560
on the basis of liberal neutrality or
non-discrimination or autonomy rights alone

577
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,900
because the question at
stake in the public debate

578
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:46,960
is whether same sex
unions have moral worth,

579
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,130
whether they're worthy
of honor and recognition,

580
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:54,300
and whether they fit the purpose
of the social institution of marriage.

581
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:59,270
So Kinsley says, you
want to be neutral?

582
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:05,770
Then, let churches and other religous
institutions offer marriage ceremonies.

583
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:10,450
Let department stores and casinos
get into the act if they want to.

584
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,220
This is Kinsley.

585
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:16,080
Let couples celebrate their
union in any way they choose

586
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,280
and consider themselves
married whenever they want.

587
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,420
And if three people
want to get married,

588
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:26,430
or if one person wants to
marry himself or herself,

589
00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:30,660
and someone else wants to
conduct a ceremony for them

590
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:32,650
and declare them
married, let them.

591
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:36,150
If you and your government aren't
implicated, what do you care?

592
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,430
This is Kinsley.

593
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:42,210
But this is not the position that
the Supreme Judicial Court

594
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,510
of Massachusetts wanted.

595
00:37:44,819 --> 00:37:49,140
They didn't call for the abolition or for
the disestablishment of marriage.

596
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:53,650
The court did not question
government's role in conferring

597
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,670
social recognition on some intimate
associations rather than others.

598
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,220
To the contrary,

599
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,520
the court waxes eloquent
about marriage

600
00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:08,330
as, "one of our community's most
rewarding and cherished institutions."

601
00:38:08,609 --> 00:38:11,440
And then it goes on to expand
the definition of marriage

602
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,770
to include partners
of the same sex.

603
00:38:14,279 --> 00:38:18,310
And in doing so
it acknowledges

604
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,200
that marriage is more
than a matter

605
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,730
of tolerating choices
that individuals make.

606
00:38:26,299 --> 00:38:30,930
It's also a matter of social
recognition and honor.

607
00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:34,970
As Justice Marshall wrote.

608
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:38,040
In a real sense there are three
partners to every civil marriage:

609
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:41,770
two willing spouses and
an approving state.

610
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:45,320
Marriage is at once a deeply
personal cimmitment,

611
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,870
but also a highly public
celebration of the ideals of

612
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:53,130
mutuality, companionship,
intimacy, fidelity, and family.

613
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,090
This is the court.

614
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,930
Now, this is reaching well
beyond liberal neutrality.

615
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:03,710
This is celebrating and affirming
marriage as an honorific,

616
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,740
as a form of public recognition.

617
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,970
And, therefore, the court found
that it couldn't avoid the debate

618
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,710
about the telos of marriage.

619
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:19,750
Justice Marshall's opinion considers
and rejects the notion

620
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,920
that the primary purpose of
marriage is procreation.

621
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,550
She points out that
there is no requirement

622
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:29,540
that applicants for marriage license,
who are heterosexuals,

623
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,120
attest to their ability or their
intention to conceive children.

624
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,400
Fertility is not a condition
of marriage.

625
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:39,240
People who cannot stir from
their deathbed, they marry.

626
00:39:39,569 --> 00:39:42,030
So she advances all
kinds of arguments,

627
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,540
along the lines that
we began last time,

628
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:50,940
about the proper and the essential
nature, the telos of marriage, is.

629
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,290
And she concludes, not
procreation but the exclusive

630
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,500
and permanent commitment
of the partners to one another

631
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:04,520
is the essential point and
purpose of marriage.

632
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:10,750
Now, nothing I've said
about this court opinion

633
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:15,100
is an argument for or against
same sex marriage.

634
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,840
But it is an argument
against the claim

635
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,850
that you can favor or oppose
same sex marriage

636
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:27,540
while remaining neutral on the underlying
moral and religious questions.

637
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,570
So all of this is to suggest

638
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:37,680
that at least in some of the
hotly contested debates

639
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,730
about justice and rights that
we have in our society,

640
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,430
the attempt to be neutral,
the attempt to say,

641
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:49,510
it's just a matter of consent
and choice and autonomy,

642
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,930
we take no stand.

643
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:53,450
That doesn't succeed.

644
00:40:54,069 --> 00:40:58,460
Even the court, which wants to be neutral
on these moral and religious disputes,

645
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:00,190
finds that it can't.

646
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:04,320
What then about our
second question?

647
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:10,270
If reasoning about the
good is unavoidable

648
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,850
in debates about
justice and rights,

649
00:41:15,759 --> 00:41:16,970
is it possible?

650
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:22,570
If reasoning about
the good means

651
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,470
that you must have a single
principle or rule or maxim

652
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:32,060
or criterion for the good life,

653
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,430
that you simply plug in
every time you have

654
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:38,930
a disagreement about morality,
then the answer is, no.

655
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:46,040
But having a single principle
or rule is not the only way,

656
00:41:46,819 --> 00:41:50,720
not the best way of reasoning

657
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:54,450
either about the good
life or about justice.

658
00:41:55,150 --> 00:42:00,430
Think back, think back to the arguments
that we've been having here

659
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:05,870
about justice and about rights and
sometimes about the good life.

660
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,870
How have those arguments
proceeded?

661
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:12,870
They've proceeded very
much in the way

662
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:20,360
that Aristotle suggests
moving back and forth

663
00:42:21,089 --> 00:42:23,500
between our judgments
about particulars,

664
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:27,730
particular cases, events,
stories, questions,

665
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:31,170
back and forth between our
judgments about particular cases

666
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:34,160
and more general principles
that make sense

667
00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:38,470
of our reasons for the positions
we take on the particular cases.

668
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:45,650
This dialectical way of doing
moral reasoning goes back

669
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:48,680
to the ancients, to
Plato and Aristotle,

670
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,970
but it doesn't stop with them,

671
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:57,140
because there is a version of Socratic
or dialectical moral reasoning

672
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,120
that is defended with great clarity
and force by John Rawls

673
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:10,590
in giving an account of his method
of justifying a theory of justice.

674
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,300
You remember it's not only the veil
of ignorance and the principles

675
00:43:14,799 --> 00:43:16,820
that Rawls argues for.

676
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:20,340
It's also a method
of moral reasoning,

677
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:25,640
reasoning about justice that
he calls reflective equilibrium.

678
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:29,170
What is the method of
reflective equilibrium?

679
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:35,850
It's moving back and forth between our
considered judgments about particular cases

680
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,720
and the general principles
we would articulate

681
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,130
to make sense of
those judgments.

682
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,470
And not just stopping there,
because we might be wrong

683
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,870
in our initial intuitions.

684
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:52,210
Not stopping there but then sometimes
revising our particular judgments

685
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:55,920
in the light of the principles
once we work them out.

686
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:01,350
So sometimes we revise the principles,
sometimes we revise our judgments

687
00:44:01,549 --> 00:44:03,910
and intuitions in the
particular cases.

688
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,380
The general point is this,
and here I quote Rawls.

689
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,990
A conception of justice can't be
deduced from self evicdent premises.

690
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:20,490
Its justification is a matter of the mustual
support of many considerations,

691
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:25,050
of everything fitting together
into one coherent view.

692
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:27,830
And later in the theory
of justice, he writes,

693
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,240
moral philosophy is Socratic.

694
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:33,220
We may want to change our
present considered judgments

695
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:38,660
once their regulative principles
are brought to light.

696
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:42,730
Well, if Rawls
accepts that idea

697
00:44:43,529 --> 00:44:47,010
and advances that notion
of reflective equilibrium,

698
00:44:47,109 --> 00:44:49,330
the question we're
left with is,

699
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,290
he applies that to
questions of justice,

700
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:58,790
not to questions of morality
and the good life.

701
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:04,700
And that's why he remains
committed to the priority

702
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:06,240
of the right over the good.

703
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:09,580
He thinks the method
of reflective equilibrium

704
00:45:10,049 --> 00:45:14,650
can generate shared judgments
about justice in the right

705
00:45:15,009 --> 00:45:18,540
but he doesn't think they can
generate shared judgments

706
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:21,650
about the good life,
about what he calls

707
00:45:21,859 --> 00:45:25,050
comprehensive moral and
religious question.

708
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,630
And the reason he thinks
that is that he says that

709
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:34,790
in modern societies there is a fact or
reasonable pluralism about the good.

710
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:38,970
Even conscientious people
who reason well,

711
00:45:39,589 --> 00:45:43,700
will find that they
disagree about questions

712
00:45:44,009 --> 00:45:46,970
of the good life, about
morality and religion.

713
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:51,880
And Rawls is likely
right about that.

714
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:56,240
He's not talking about the fact of
disagreement in pluralist societies.

715
00:45:56,569 --> 00:46:00,340
He's also suggesting that
there may be persisting

716
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,450
disagreements about the good life and
about moral and religious questions.

717
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:12,460
But if that's true, then

718
00:46:14,129 --> 00:46:16,930
is he warranted in
his further claim

719
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:21,130
that the same can't be
said about justice?

720
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:27,320
Isn't it also true, not only that
we, as a matter of fact, disagree

721
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,960
about justice in
pluralist societies,

722
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,900
but that at least some of those disagreements
are reasonable disagreements?

723
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,660
In the same way,

724
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,100
some people favor a libertarian
theory of justice,

725
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:47,620
others are more egalitarian theory
of justice and they argue.

726
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:53,080
And there is pluralism in our society
as between free market laissez faire,

727
00:46:53,279 --> 00:46:58,090
libertarian theories of justice
and more egalitarian ones.

728
00:46:59,029 --> 00:47:01,310
Is there any difference
in principle

729
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:05,960
between the kind of moral reasoning and
the kind of disagreements that arise

730
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,580
when we debate about justice

731
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,600
and the meaning
of free speech

732
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,240
and the nature of
religious liberty?

733
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,880
Look at the debates
we have over

734
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,700
appointees to the
Supreme Court.

735
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:23,280
These are all disagreements
about justice and rights.

736
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:29,260
Is there any difference between
the fact of reasonable pluralism

737
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:36,370
in the case of justice and rights and
in the case of morality and religion?

738
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,520
In principle I don't
think that there is.

739
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:44,690
In both cases what we
do when we disagree is

740
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:49,610
we engage with our interlocutor, as we've
been doing here for an entire semester.

741
00:47:50,259 --> 00:47:54,730
We consider the arguments that are
provoked by particular cases.

742
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:59,320
We try to develop the reasons that lead
us to go one way rather than another.

743
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:02,090
And then we listen to the
reasons of other people.

744
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:06,510
And sometimes we're persuaded
to revise our view.

745
00:48:06,609 --> 00:48:10,320
Other times we're challenged at least
to shore up and strengthen our view.

746
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,220
But this is how moral
argument proceeds,

747
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,800
with justice, and so it
seems to me, also

748
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:24,380
with questions of
the good life.

749
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:30,100
Now, there remains
a further worry

750
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,400
and it's a liberal worry,

751
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:41,090
what about if we are going to think of our
disagreements about morality and religion

752
00:48:42,109 --> 00:48:44,670
as bound up with our
disagreements about justice,

753
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,830
how are we ever going to
find our way to a society

754
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:55,950
that accords respect to fellow
citizens with whom we disagree?

755
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:06,780
It depends I think on which conception
of respect one accepts.

756
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:12,020
On the liberal conception, to
respect our fellow citizens'

757
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,910
moral and religious convictions,
is, so to speak, to ignore them,

758
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:18,950
for political purposes.

759
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,360
To rise above or to abstract
from or to set aside

760
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:25,170
those moral and
religious convictions.

761
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:29,290
To leave them undisturbed,
to carry on our political debate

762
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,970
without reference to them.

763
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,830
But that isn't the only way,

764
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,010
or perhaps even the
most plausible way

765
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,810
of understanding the
mutual respect

766
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:46,250
on which democratic
life depends.

767
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:51,600
There is a different conception of
respect according to which we respect

768
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,940
our fellow citizens' moral
and religious convictions,

769
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:58,180
not by ignoring, but
by engaging them.

770
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:00,500
By attending to them.

771
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:03,980
Sometimes by challenging
and contesting them.

772
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,760
Sometimes by listening and
learning from them.

773
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,230
Now, there's no guarantee
that a politics

774
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:17,300
of moral and religious attention
and engagement

775
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:20,150
will lead in any given
case to agreement.

776
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,750
There is no guarantee it will
lead even to appreciation

777
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,020
for the moral and religious
convictions of others.

778
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:28,980
It's always possible,
after all,

779
00:50:29,629 --> 00:50:32,640
that learning more about a
religious or a moral doctrine

780
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,380
will lead us to like it less.

781
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,230
But the respect of deliberation
and engagement

782
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:46,430
seems to me a more adequate, more
suitable ideal for a pluralist society.

783
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:51,810
And to the extent that our moral
and religious disagreements reflect

784
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:54,920
some ultimate plurality
of human goods.

785
00:50:55,779 --> 00:51:01,610
A politics of moral engagement will
better enable us, so it seems to me,

786
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:06,830
to appreciate the distinctive goods
our different lives expressed.

787
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:13,420
When we first came together
some 13 weeks ago,

788
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:17,360
I spoke of the exhilaration
of political philosophy

789
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,680
and also of its dangers.

790
00:51:20,799 --> 00:51:25,660
About how philosophy works
and has always worked

791
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:34,080
by estranging us from the familiar
by unsettling our settled assumptions.

792
00:51:35,799 --> 00:51:40,270
And I tried to warn you that once
the familiar turns strange,

793
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:44,390
once we begin to reflect
on our circumstance,

794
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:47,690
it's never quite the same again.

795
00:51:49,509 --> 00:51:54,090
I hope you have by now experienced
at least a little of this unease

796
00:51:55,210 --> 00:52:00,750
because this is the tension that animates
critical reflection and political improvement

797
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:04,170
and maybe even the
moral life as well.

798
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:07,990
And so our argument comes
to an end, in a sense,

799
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,310
but in another
sense goes on.

800
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:13,600
Why, we asked at the outset,

801
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:18,910
why did these arguments keep
going even if they raise questions

802
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:22,430
that are impossible ever,
finally, to resolve?

803
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:29,360
The reason is that we live some answer
to these questions all the time.

804
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:33,750
In our public life, and
in our personal lives,

805
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:40,630
philosophy is inescapable even
if it sometimes seems impossible.

806
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,580
We began with the
thought of Kant,

807
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,960
that skepticism is a resting
place for human reason.

808
00:52:48,549 --> 00:52:52,340
Where it can reflect upon
its dogmatic wanderings,

809
00:52:53,149 --> 00:52:56,580
but it is no dwelling place
for permanent settlement.

810
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:00,830
To allow ourselves simply to
acquiescence in skepticism

811
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,990
or in complacence, Kant
wrote, can never suffice

812
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:08,460
to overcome the
restlessness of reason.

813
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,530
The aim of this course
has been to awaken

814
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,410
the restlessness of reason

815
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,630
and to see where it might lead.

816
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,640
And if we had done
at least that,

817
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:23,090
and if the restlessness
continues to afflict you

818
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:26,560
in the days and
years to come,

819
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:30,980
then we together have
achieved no small thing.

820
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:32,570
Thank you.
