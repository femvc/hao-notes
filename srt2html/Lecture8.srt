1
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:31,790
Today, we turn

2
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,630
to the question of
distributive justice.

3
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,340
How should income
in wealth and power

4
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,430
and opportunities
be distributed?

5
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,390
According to what principles?

6
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,510
John Rawls offers a detailed
answer to that question.

7
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,510
And we're going to examine
and assess his answer

8
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,900
to that question, today.

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,290
We put ourselves in a
position to do so last time.

10
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:02,400
By trying to make sense
of why he thinks

11
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,810
that principles of justice

12
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:15,230
are best derived from a
hypothetical contract.

13
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,590
And what matters is that
the hypothetical contract

14
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,720
be carried out in an original
position of equality,

15
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,540
behind, what Rawls calls,
the veil of ignorance.

16
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,200
So that much is clear?

17
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,020
Alright, then let's turn
to the principles

18
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,070
that Rawls says
would be chosen

19
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:48,200
behind the veil of ignorance.

20
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,120
First, he considered some of
the major alternatives.

21
00:01:56,059 --> 00:01:57,940
What about utilitarianism?

22
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,580
Would the people in
the original position

23
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,790
choose to govern
their collective lives

24
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,910
utilitarian principles, the greatest
good for the greatest number?

25
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:13,700
No, they wouldn't, Rawls says.

26
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,970
And the reason is,

27
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:20,380
that behind the veil of ignorance,
everyone knows

28
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,580
that once the veil goes up,
and real life begins,

29
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,990
we will each want to be
respected with dignity.

30
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,910
Even if we turn out to be
a member of a minority.

31
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:42,170
We don't want to be oppressed.

32
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,180
And so we would agree

33
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,980
to reject utilitarianism,
and instead to adopt

34
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,040
as our first principle,
equal basic liberties.

35
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,780
Fundamental rights to
freedom of speech,

36
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,040
freedom of assembly,
religious liberty,

37
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,280
freedom of conscience
and the like.

38
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,120
We wouldn't want to
take the chance

39
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:12,680
that we would wind up

40
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,820
as members of an oppressed
or a despised minority

41
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,600
with the majority
tyrannizing over us.

42
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,010
And so Rawls says utilitarianism
would be rejected.

43
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,550
"Utilitarianism makes the
mistake", Rawls writes,

44
00:03:37,619 --> 00:03:41,230
"of forgetting, or at least
not taking seriously,

45
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:43,660
the distinction between persons."

46
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,420
And in the original position
behind the veil of ignorance,

47
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:51,190
we would recognize that
and reject utilitarianism.

48
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,180
We wouldn't trade off our
fundamental rights and liberties

49
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:57,580
for any economic advantages.

50
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,460
That's the first principle.

51
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,110
Second principle has to do with
social and economic inequalities.

52
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:10,670
What would we agree to?

53
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:13,780
Remember, we don't know
whether we're going to

54
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,860
wind up rich or poor.

55
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:18,420
Healthy or unhealthy.

56
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,590
We don't know what kind of family
we're going to come from.

57
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,980
Whether we're going
to inherit millions

58
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,170
or whether we will come from
an impoverished family.

59
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,530
So we might, at
first thought,

60
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:42,180
say, "Well let's require an equal
distribution of income and wealth."

61
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:47,190
Just to be on the safe side.

62
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,540
But then we would realize,

63
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:54,840
that we could do
better than that.

64
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:58,600
Even if we're unlucky and
wind up at the bottom.

65
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:06,310
We could do better if we agree to
a qualified principle of equality.

66
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,890
Rawls calls it
"the Difference Principle".

67
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:15,200
A principle that says, only
those social and economic

68
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,100
inequalities will be permitted
that work to the benefit

69
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,650
of the least well off.

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,390
So we wouldn't reject all
inequality of income and wealth.

71
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,590
We would allow some.

72
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,860
But the test would be,

73
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:36,090
do they work to the benefit of
everyone including those,

74
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:38,830
or as he specifies, the principle,

75
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:42,540
especially those at the bottom.

76
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,650
Only those inequalities would be
accepted behind the veil of ignorance.

77
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,220
And so Rawls argues, only those
inequalities that work to the benefit

78
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,260
of the least well off, are just.

79
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,700
We talked about
the examples of

80
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:05,030
Michael Jordan making
31 million dollars a year.

81
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:09,950
Of Bill Gates having a fortune
in the tens of billions.

82
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,980
Would those inequalities be permitted
under the difference principle?

83
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,870
Only if they were part of a system,
those wage differentials,

84
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,930
that actually work to the
advantage of least well off.

85
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,200
Well, what would
that system be?

86
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,670
Maybe it turns out that
as a practical matter

87
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:34,550
you have to provide incentives

88
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:39,490
to attract the right
people to certain jobs.

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,240
And when you do, having
those people in those jobs

90
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,630
will actually help those
at the bottom.

91
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:55,090
Strictly speaking, Rawls's argument
for the difference principle

92
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,190
is that it would be chosen
behind the veil of ignorance.

93
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:01,880
Let me hear what
you think about

94
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,970
Rawls's claim that these two
principles would be chosen

95
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,450
behind the veil of ignorance.

96
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:14,050
Is there anyone who disagrees
that they would be chosen?

97
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,710
Alright, let's start up in the
balcony, if that's alright.

98
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:18,540
Go ahead.

99
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,950
OK, your argument depends
upon us believing that

100
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:25,520
we would argue in said policy,
or justice from a bottom.

101
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,270
For the disadvantaged.

102
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,630
And I just don't see from
a proof standpoint,

103
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:30,300
where we've proven that.

104
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,270
Why not the top?

105
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,590
Right, and what's your name?
- Mike.

106
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,370
Mike, alright, good question.

107
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:39,680
Put yourself behind
the veil of ignorance.

108
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,260
Enter into the thought experiment.

109
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,810
What principles would you choose?

110
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,700
How would you think it through?

111
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,970
Well, I would say things like,
even Harvard's existence

112
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,000
is an example of preaching
toward the top.

113
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:54,850
Because Harvard takes
the top academics.

114
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,280
And I didn't know when I was
born how smart I would be.

115
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,340
But I worked my life to get
to a place of this caliber.

116
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:03,220
Now, if you had said Harvard's going
to randomly take 1600 people

117
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,200
of absolutely no qualification,
we'd all be saying,

118
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:08,230
"There's not much to work for."

119
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:11,940
And so what principle
would you choose?

120
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,750
In that situation I would
say a merit based one.

121
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:19,100
One where I don't necessarily know, but
I would rather have a system that

122
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,010
rewards me based
on my efforts.

123
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,550
So you, Mike, behind
the veil of ignorance,

124
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,290
would choose a
merit-based system,

125
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,560
where people are rewarded
according to their efforts?

126
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,720
Alright, fair enough.
What would you say?

127
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,930
Go ahead.

128
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,380
My question is, if the merit-based
argument is based on

129
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,740
when everyone is at
a level of equality?

130
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:49,850
Where from that position, you're
rewarded to where you get,

131
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:55,460
or is it regardless of what
advantages you may have

132
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,490
when you began your education
to get where you are here?

133
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,960
I think what the question
you're asking is saying that

134
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,580
if we want to look at,
whatever, utilitarianism, policy,

135
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,620
do you want to maximize
world wealth.

136
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,430
And I think a system
that rewards merit

137
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,000
is the one that we've pretty
much all established,

138
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,190
is what is best for all of us.

139
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,540
Despite the fact that some of us
may be in the second percentile

140
00:09:16,819 --> 00:09:18,680
and some may be in
the 98th percentile.

141
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:22,680
At the end of the day it lifts
that lowest based level,

142
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,410
a community that rewards effort
as opposed to an differences.

143
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:33,550
But, I don't understand how you're
rewards someone's efforts

144
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,890
who clearly has had, not
you, but maybe myself,

145
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,680
advantages throughout,
to get where I am here.

146
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,720
I mean, I can't say
that somebody else

147
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,520
who maybe worked
as hard as I did

148
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,140
would have had the same
opportunity to come

149
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,710
to a school like this.

150
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,810
Alright, let's look at that point.
What's your name?

151
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:55,750
Kate. -Kate, you suspect
that the ability

152
00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:01,260
to get into top schools
may largely depend

153
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,570
on coming from
an affluent family.

154
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,510
Having a favorable
family background,

155
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:13,010
social, cultural, economic
advantages and so on?

156
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,820
I mean, economic, but
yes, social, cultural.

157
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,880
All of those advantages,
for sure.

158
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,550
Someone did a study,
of the 146 selective

159
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,270
colleges and universities
in the United States.

160
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:27,770
And they looked at the students

161
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,990
in those colleges and universities

162
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,560
to try to find out what their background
was, their economic background.

163
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,570
What percentage do you think,
come from the bottom quarter

164
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:43,890
of the income scale?

165
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,240
You know what the figure is?

166
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:52,490
Only three percent of students, at the
most selective colleges and universities

167
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:54,340
come from poor backgrounds.

168
00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:00,720
Over 70 percent come
from affluent families.

169
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:05,970
Let's go one step further then,
and try to address Mike's challenge.

170
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:11,950
Rawls actually has two
arguments, not one,

171
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,120
in favor of his principles of justice.

172
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:19,310
And in particular, of
the difference principle.

173
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,060
One argument is the
official argument,

174
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,940
what would be chosen behind
the veil of ignorance.

175
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,960
Some people challenge
that argument, saying,

176
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:33,870
"Maybe people would want
to take their chances.

177
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,460
Maybe people would be gamblers
behind the veil of ignorance.

178
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,390
Hoping that they would
wind up on top."

179
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,400
That's one challenge that
has been put to Rawls.

180
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,940
But backing up the argument
from the original position

181
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:50,580
is the second argument.

182
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,060
And that is the straightforwardly
moral argument.

183
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:56,560
And it goes like this,

184
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,570
it says,

185
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,990
the distribution of income and
wealth and opportunities

186
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,690
should not be based on factors

187
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,600
for which people can
claim no credit.

188
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:19,210
It shouldn't be based on factors that are
arbitrary from a moral point of view.

189
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:28,230
Rawls illustrates this by considering
several rival theories of justice.

190
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,250
He begins with the
theory of justice

191
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,820
that most everyone
these days would reject.

192
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,070
A feudal aristocracy.

193
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:49,180
What's wrong with the allocation of
life prospects in a feudal aristocracy?

194
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,010
Rawls says, well the thing that's
obviously wrong about it is

195
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:56,800
that people's life prospects
are determined

196
00:12:57,689 --> 00:12:59,310
by the accident of birth.

197
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,150
Are you born to a noble family or
to a family of peasants and serfs?

198
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,420
And that's it.
You can't rise.

199
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,560
It's not your doing
where you wind up

200
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,360
or what opportunities
you have.

201
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,140
But that's arbitrary from
a moral point of view.

202
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,450
And so that objection
to feudal aristocracy

203
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:26,110
leads, and historically has
lead, people to say,

204
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,620
careers should be
open to talents.

205
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,810
There should be formal
equality of opportunity

206
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,970
regardless of the accident
of birth.

207
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,330
Every person should be free
to strive, to work,

208
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,550
to apply for any job
in the society.

209
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:48,530
And then, if you open up jobs,
and you allow people to apply,

210
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:53,230
and to work as hard as they can,
then the results are just.

211
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,200
So it's more or less the libertarian
system that we've discussed

212
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,610
in earlier weeks.

213
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,480
What does Rawls think
about this?

214
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,360
He says it's an improvement.

215
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,440
It's an improvement because
it doesn't take as fixed

216
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,870
the accident of birth.

217
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,110
But even with formal
equality of opportunity

218
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,570
the libertarian conception
doesn't extend that,

219
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,400
doesn't extend its
insight far enough.

220
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:25,000
Because if you let
everybody run the race,

221
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,800
everybody can enter the race,
but some people start

222
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,460
at different starting points,
that race isn't going to be fair.

223
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,070
Intuitively, he says, the most
obvious injustice of this system

224
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,660
is that it permits distributive shares
to be improperly influenced

225
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,690
by factors arbitrary from
a moral point of view.

226
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,290
Such as, whether you got
a good education or not.

227
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,480
Whether you grew up in
a family that support you

228
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:54,510
and developed in
you a work ethic

229
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,420
and gave you the
opportunities.

230
00:14:57,849 --> 00:15:01,150
So that suggests moving
to a system of fair

231
00:15:01,349 --> 00:15:03,760
equality of opportunity.

232
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,600
And that's really the system that
Mike was advocating earlier on.

233
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,580
What we might call
a merit-based system.

234
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,660
A meritocratic system.

235
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,450
In a fair meritocracy the society
sets up institutions

236
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,920
to bring everyone to the
same starting point

237
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,590
before the race begins.

238
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,590
Equal educational opportunities.

239
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:30,540
Head start programs,
for example.

240
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,770
Support for schools in
impoverished neighborhoods.

241
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,420
So that everyone, regardless
of their family background,

242
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:43,780
has a genuinely fair opportunity.

243
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:47,480
Everyone starts from the
same starting line.

244
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,920
Well, what does Rawls think
about the meritocratic system?

245
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,140
Even that, he says,
doesn't go far enough

246
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:03,060
in remedying,
or addressing,

247
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,750
the moral arbitrariness

248
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,930
of the natural lottery.

249
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,290
Because if you bring everyone
to the same starting point

250
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,310
and begin the race,
who's going to win the race?

251
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,340
Who would win?

252
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,850
To use the runners example.

253
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:28,210
The fastest runners would win.

254
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,630
But is it their doing

255
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,970
that they happen to be blessed
with athletic prowess to run fast?

256
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:46,160
So Rawls says, "Even the
principle of meritocracy,

257
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,020
where you bring everyone
to the same starting point,

258
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,470
may eliminate the influence of social
contingencies and upbringing,

259
00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:57,760
...but it still permits the distribution of
wealth and income to be determined

260
00:16:57,859 --> 00:17:02,180
by the natural distribution
of abilities and talents."

261
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:06,400
And so he thinks that the
principle of eliminating

262
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:09,880
morally arbitrary influences in the
distribution of income and wealth

263
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,390
requires going beyond

264
00:17:14,389 --> 00:17:17,950
what Mike favors,
the meritocratic system.

265
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,930
Now, how do you go beyond?

266
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,500
Do you bring everyone to
the same starting point

267
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,950
and you're still bothered
by the fact that

268
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,740
some are fast runners and
some are not fast runners,

269
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,780
what can you do?

270
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:35,190
Well, some critics of a more
egalitarian conception

271
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,340
say the only thing you can do
is handicap the fast runners.

272
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,190
Make them wear lead shoes.

273
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,170
But who wants to do that?

274
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,870
That would defeat the whole
point of running the race.

275
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,540
But Rawls says, you
don't have to have

276
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:57,660
a kind of leveling equality,
if you want to go

277
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,930
beyond a meritocratic conception.

278
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:03,490
You permit, you
even encourage,

279
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:09,830
those who may be gifted,
to exercise their talents.

280
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,940
But what you do,
is you change the terms

281
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,280
on which people are
entitled to the fruits of

282
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,430
the exercise of those talents.

283
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,470
And that really is what
the difference principle is.

284
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,980
You establish a
principle that says,

285
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:27,910
people may benefit from
their good fortune,

286
00:18:29,629 --> 00:18:31,440
from their luck in
the genetic lottery,

287
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,340
but only on terms that work to the
advantage of the least well off.

288
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,070
And so, for example,

289
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,650
Michael Jordan can make
31 million dollars but,

290
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:50,060
only under a system that
taxes away a chunk of that

291
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,680
to help those who lack the basketball
skills that he's blessed with.

292
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,840
Likewise, Bill Gates.

293
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,980
He can make his billions.

294
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,780
But he can't think that he
somehow morally deserves

295
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,130
those billions.

296
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,380
"Those who have been
favored by nature,

297
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:12,030
may gain from their good fortune
but only on terms that improve

298
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,430
the situation of those
who have lost out."

299
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:16,620
That's the difference principle.

300
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,730
And it's an argument from
moral arbitrarianists.

301
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,280
Rawls claims, that if you're bothered
by basing distributive shares

302
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,680
on factors arbitrary from
a moral point of view,

303
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,420
you don't just reject a feudal
aristocracy for a free market.

304
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:38,070
You don't even rest content
with a meritocratic system

305
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:41,230
that brings everyone to
the same starting point.

306
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:46,300
You set up a system, where everyone,
including those at the bottom,

307
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,240
benefit from the exercise of
the talents held by those

308
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,350
who happen to be lucky.

309
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,940
What do you think?
Is that persuasive?

310
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,900
Who finds that argument
unpersuasive?

311
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,070
The argument for
moral arbitrarianists.

312
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,840
Yes.

313
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,900
I think that in the
egalitarian proposition

314
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:12,950
the more talented people,

315
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,350
I think it's very optimistic
to think that they

316
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,520
would still work really hard,
even if they knew that

317
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,020
part of what they made
would be given away.

318
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:27,110
So I think that the only way for
the more talented people to

319
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,480
exercise their talents to
the best of their ability

320
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,050
is in the meritocracy.

321
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,470
And in a meritocracy,
what's your name?

322
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,390
Kate.

323
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:38,540
Kate, does it bother you, and
Mike, does it bother you,

324
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,890
that in a meritocratic system, that even
with fair equality of opportunity,

325
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,240
people get ahead, people get
rewards that they don't deserve

326
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:53,490
simply because they happen
to be naturally gifted.

327
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,510
What about that?

328
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,120
I think that it is arbitrary.

329
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,880
Obviously it's arbitrary.

330
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:03,750
But I think that correcting for
it would be detrimental.

331
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,700
Because it would reduce
incentives, is that why?

332
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:09,500
It would reduce incentives, yeah.

333
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,870
Mike, what do you say?

334
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,390
We're all sitting in this room
and we have undeserved,

335
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:16,660
we have undeserved
glory of some sort.

336
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:20,110
So you should not be satisfied
with the process of your life.

337
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,010
Because you have not
created any of this.

338
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,780
And I think, from a standpoint of,
not just this room, us being upset,

339
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,710
but from a societal standpoint
we should have some kind of

340
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,260
a gut reaction to that feeling.

341
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,670
The guy who runs the
race, he doesn't...

342
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:35,340
He actually harms us as opposed
to maybe makes me run that last

343
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,640
ten yards faster.

344
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,150
And that makes the guy behind
me run ten yards faster

345
00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:41,190
and the guy behind
him ten yards faster.

346
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,680
Alright, so Mike,
let me ask you.

347
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,780
You talked about effort before.
Effort.

348
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,850
Do you think when people work
hard to get ahead, and succeed,

349
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,930
that they deserve the rewards
that go with effort?

350
00:21:55,129 --> 00:21:56,780
Isn't that the idea behind
your defense?

351
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,630
I mean, of course, bring
Michael Jordan here,

352
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,490
I'm sure you can get him,
and have him come

353
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,570
and defend himself about
he makes 31 million dollars.

354
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,950
And I think what you're
going to realize is

355
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,650
his life was a very, very tough
one to get to the top.

356
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:12,580
And that we are basically being the majority
oppressing the minority in a different light.

357
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,330
It's very easy to pick on him.
Very easy.

358
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,700
Alright, effort.

359
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:18,930
You've got...

360
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,810
I've got a few. I've got a few.
But that's about it.

361
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:26,370
Effort, you know what
Rawls's answer to that is?

362
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,260
Even the effort that
some people expend,

363
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,160
conscientious driving,
the work ethic,

364
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:40,430
even effort depends a lot on
fortunate family circumstances.

365
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,950
For which you, we,
can claim no credit.

366
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:51,590
Let's do the test.
Let's do a test here.

367
00:22:52,889 --> 00:22:57,100
Never mind economic class, those
differences are very significant.

368
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,770
Put those aside.

369
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:03,470
Psychologists say that birth
order makes a lot of difference

370
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,940
in work ethic, striving,
effort.

371
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,450
How many here,
raise your hand,

372
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,390
those of you here,
who are first in birth order.

373
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,080
I am too by the way.

374
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,620
Mike, I noticed you
raised your hand.

375
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:33,380
If the case for the
meritocratic conception

376
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,940
is that effort should
be rewarded,

377
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,540
doesn't Rawls have a
point that even effort

378
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,990
striving, work ethic is largely
shaped even by birth order?

379
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:49,760
Is it your doing?

380
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:53,340
Mike, is it your doing that you
were first in birth order?

381
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:58,880
Then why, Rawls says,
of course not.

382
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,710
So why should income and wealth
and opportunities in life

383
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,890
be based on factors arbitrary
from a moral point of view?

384
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,320
That's the challenge that he puts

385
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:20,850
to market societies,
but also

386
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:25,080
to those of us at
places like this.

387
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,350
A question to think
about for next time.

388
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:39,730
A justice of the United States
Supreme Court,

389
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,660
what do they make?

390
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,110
It's just under $200,000.

391
00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:51,180
But there's another judge who makes
a lot more than Sandra Day O'Connor.

392
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,250
Do you know who it is?
- Judge Judy?

393
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,000
Judge Judy.
How did you know that?

394
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,860
Judge Judy, you know
how much she makes?

395
00:25:02,189 --> 00:25:04,810
$25 million.

396
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:09,280
Now, is that just?
Is it fair?

397
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:18,240
We ended last time with that
remarkable poll, do you remember?

398
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,680
The poll about birth order.

399
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:27,990
What percentage of people

400
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,050
in this room raised
their hands,

401
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:37,000
was it, to say that they
were the first born?

402
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:42,250
75, 80 percent?

403
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,310
And what was the
significance of that?

404
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:50,030
If you're thinking about these
theories of distributive justice.

405
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,850
Remember, we were discussing

406
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,690
three different theories
of distributive justice.

407
00:26:01,389 --> 00:26:03,140
Three different ways of
answering the question,

408
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,530
"How should income and wealth
and opportunities

409
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,410
and the good things in
life, be distributed?"

410
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,520
And so far we've looked
at the libertarian answer.

411
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,100
That says, the just
system of distribution

412
00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:20,750
is a system of free exchange,
a free market economy.

413
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,970
Against a background
of formal equality.

414
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:30,540
Which simply means, that jobs and
careers are open to anyone.

415
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:35,290
Rawls says that this represents
an improvement

416
00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:39,500
over aristocratic and caste systems,

417
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,900
because everyone can
compete for every job.

418
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:44,860
Careers open to talents.

419
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:47,600
And beyond that, the just
distribution is the one

420
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,950
that results from free exchange.

421
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,980
Voluntary transactions.

422
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,390
No more, no less.

423
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:02,490
Then Rawls argues, if all you
have is formal equality,

424
00:27:02,699 --> 00:27:04,510
jobs open to everyone,

425
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:08,970
the result is not
going to be fair.

426
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:14,120
It will be biased in favor of
those who happen to be born

427
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,520
to affluent families,

428
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,880
who happen to have the benefit of
good educational opportunities.

429
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,430
And that accident of birth

430
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,370
is not a just basis for
distributing life chances.

431
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:39,320
And so, many people who
notice this unfairness,

432
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:47,920
Rawls argues, are lead to embrace a
system of fair equality of opportunity.

433
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,700
That leads to the
meritocratic system.

434
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,560
Fair equality of opportunity.

435
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,270
But Rawls says, even if
you bring everyone

436
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,790
to the same starting
point in the race,

437
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,970
what's going to happen?
Who's going to win?

438
00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:10,780
The fastest runners.

439
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,430
So once you're troubled by
basing distributive shares

440
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,140
on morally arbitrary contingencies,

441
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,610
you should, if you
reason it through,

442
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:27,910
be carried all the way to what Rawls
calls, "the democratic conception".

443
00:28:28,379 --> 00:28:32,170
A more egalitarian conception
of distributive justice

444
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:36,400
that he defines by
the difference principle.

445
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,940
Now, he doesn't say that
the only way to remedy

446
00:28:41,939 --> 00:28:46,310
or to compensate for differences
in natural talents and abilities

447
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:50,950
is to have a kind of,
leveling equality.

448
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:53,070
A guaranteed equality
of outcome.

449
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:54,740
But he does say

450
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:59,500
there's another way to deal
with these contingencies.

451
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:05,500
People may gain, may benefit
from their good fortune,

452
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:09,470
but only on terms that work to the
advantage of the least well off.

453
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:15,850
And so, we can test how
this theory actually works

454
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,560
by thinking about some
paid differentials that arise

455
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,900
in our society.

456
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,700
What does the average
school teacher make

457
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,490
in the United States,
do you suppose?

458
00:29:29,379 --> 00:29:32,280
Roughly.
-$35,000.

459
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,970
It's a little more, 40, $42,000.

460
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:37,340
What about David Letterman?

461
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,020
How much do you think
David Letterman makes?

462
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:41,940
More than a school teacher?

463
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:49,230
$31 million.
David Letterman.

464
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:51,140
Is that fair?

465
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:55,240
That David Letterman makes that
much more than a school teacher?

466
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,280
Well, Rawls's answer would be,

467
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:03,390
it depends whether the basic structure
of society is designed in such a way

468
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:08,330
that Letterman's $31 million
is subject to taxation

469
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:11,440
so that some of those
earnings are taken

470
00:30:11,639 --> 00:30:15,800
to work for the advantage
of the least well off.

471
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:19,690
One other example of
a paid differential.

472
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,740
A justice of the United States
Supreme Court.

473
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:26,850
What do they make?

474
00:30:29,689 --> 00:30:32,390
It's just under $200,000.

475
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:38,420
Here's Sandra Day O'Connor,
for example. There she is.

476
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,430
But there's another judge
who makes a lot more

477
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,870
than Sandra Day O'Connor.

478
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,040
Do you know who it is?
- Judge Judy.

479
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,680
Judge Judy.
How did you know that?

480
00:30:53,379 --> 00:30:55,420
You watch?

481
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,980
You're right.

482
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,030
Judge Judy, you know
how much she makes?

483
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,420
There she is.

484
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:08,300
$25 million.

485
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:15,020
Now, is that just?
Is it fair?

486
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:20,420
Well, the answer is,
it depends on whether

487
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,190
this is against
a background system

488
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:26,900
in line with
the difference principle.

489
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,070
Where those who come
out on top, in terms of

490
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:33,640
income and wealth are
taxed in a way

491
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:37,460
that benefits the least
well off members of society.

492
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,480
Now, we're going to come back

493
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:45,530
to these wage differentials,
pay differentials,

494
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:50,230
between a real judge
and a TV judge.

495
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,470
The one Marcus watches
all the time.

496
00:31:55,399 --> 00:31:59,090
What I want to do now,
is return to these theories

497
00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:05,990
and to examine the objections to

498
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:10,760
Rawls's more egalitarian theory.

499
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:12,740
The difference principle.

500
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,740
There are at least
three objections

501
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,680
to Rawls's difference principle.

502
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,890
One of them came up last
time in the discussion

503
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,560
and a number of you
raised this worry.

504
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,590
What about incentives?

505
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:37,280
Isn't there the risk, if taxes reach
70, 80, 90 percent marginal rate

506
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:42,190
that Michael Jordan
won't play basketball?

507
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:48,220
That David Letterman won't
do late night comedy?

508
00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:57,470
Or that CEOs will go into
some other line of work?

509
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,940
Now, who among those who
are defenders of Rawls

510
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:06,950
who has an answer to
this objection about

511
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,280
the need for incentives?

512
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:13,580
Yes. Go ahead, stand up.

513
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:19,630
Rawls's idea is that there should
only be so much difference

514
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,830
that it helps the least
well off the most.

515
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:27,480
So if there's too much equality,
then the least well off

516
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,520
might not be able to
watch late night TV,

517
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:33,290
or might not have a job because
their CEO doesn't want to work.

518
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,680
So you need to find the
correct balance where

519
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:41,230
taxation still leaves enough incentive
to least well off to benefit

520
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:43,160
from the talents.
- Good.

521
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,620
And what's your name?
- Tim.

522
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,440
Tim. Alright, so Tim is
saying, in effect,

523
00:33:47,649 --> 00:33:50,240
that Rawls is taking
count of incentives.

524
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,350
And could allow for pay
differentials and

525
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,820
for some adjustment
in the tax rate

526
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,830
to take account of incentives.

527
00:33:59,189 --> 00:34:00,500
But, Tim points out,

528
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:09,070
the standpoint from which the question
of incentives needs to be considered

529
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:13,720
is not the effect on the total
size of the economic pie.

530
00:34:14,529 --> 00:34:17,120
But instead from the
standpoint of the effect

531
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,970
of incentives, or disincentives,

532
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,950
on the well-being of
those on the bottom.

533
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,040
Right?

534
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,660
Good. Thank you.

535
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,330
I think that is what
Rawls would say.

536
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:32,270
In fact, if you look
in section 17,

537
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,660
where he describes
the difference principle,

538
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:43,140
he allows for incentives.

539
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,480
"The naturally advantaged
are not gain

540
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,300
merely because they
are more gifted,

541
00:34:49,819 --> 00:34:52,460
but only to cover the costs
of training and education

542
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:57,350
and for using their endowments in
ways that help less fortunate as well."

543
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,720
So you can have incentives.
You can adjust the tax rate.

544
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:04,900
If taking too much from
David Letterman

545
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,060
or from Michael Jordan,
or from Bill Gates,

546
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,710
winds up actually hurting
those at the bottom.

547
00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:14,500
That's the test.

548
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,770
So incentives, that's not a
decisive objections against

549
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,040
Rawls's difference principle.

550
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:29,790
But there are two weightier,
more difficult objections.

551
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:34,020
One of them

552
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:41,960
comes from defenders of
a meritocratic conception.

553
00:35:44,049 --> 00:35:46,980
The argument that says,
what about effort?

554
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,010
What about people
working hard

555
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,200
having a right
to what they earn

556
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,860
because they've deserved it.

557
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,590
They've worked hard for it.

558
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:01,060
That's the objection from
effort and moral desert.

559
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:05,130
Then there's another objection.

560
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:10,100
That comes from libertarians.

561
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:16,650
And this objection has to do
with reasserting the idea

562
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:19,060
of self-ownership.

563
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:25,300
Doesn't the difference principle,
by treating

564
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:29,240
our natural talents and
endowments as common assets,

565
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:35,700
doesn't that violate the idea
that we own ourselves?

566
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,850
Now, let me deal first,

567
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:44,710
with the objection that comes
from the libertarian direction.

568
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:49,960
Milton Friedman writes,
in his book, "Free to Choose,"

569
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,130
"Life is not fair.

570
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:56,960
And it's tempting to believe
that government can rectify

571
00:36:57,609 --> 00:36:59,810
what nature has spawned."

572
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:02,320
But his answer is,

573
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,880
"The only way to try to
rectify that is to have

574
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,540
a leveling equality
of outcome."

575
00:37:11,819 --> 00:37:13,600
Everyone finishing the
race at the same point.

576
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,570
And that would be a disaster.

577
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,820
This is an easy argument
to answer.

578
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,220
And Rawls addresses it.

579
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:32,250
In one of the most powerful
passages, I think,

580
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,690
of the theory of justice.

581
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:36,790
It's in Section 17.

582
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:40,760
"The natural distribution",
and here he's talking about

583
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,490
the natural distribution
talents and endowments.

584
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,550
"...is neither just nor unjust.

585
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,750
"Nor is it unjust that persons are born
into society at some particular position.

586
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,500
These are simply natural facts.

587
00:37:52,779 --> 00:37:55,810
What is just and unjust is
the way that institutions

588
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,800
deal with these facts."

589
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:05,240
That's his answer to libertarian
laissez faire economists

590
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:09,080
like Milton Friedman who say,
"Life is unfair but get over it."

591
00:38:10,799 --> 00:38:13,260
Get over it and let's see
if we can, at least,

592
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,900
maximize the benefits
that flow from it.

593
00:38:18,299 --> 00:38:21,200
But the more powerful
libertarian objection to Rawls

594
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:24,890
is not libertarian from the libertarian
economists like Milton Friedman.

595
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:29,430
It's from the argument
about self-ownership.

596
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,770
Developed as we saw,
in Nozick.

597
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,880
And from that point of view,

598
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,190
yes, it might be a good thing,

599
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,880
to create head start programs
and public schools

600
00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:46,520
so that everyone can
go to a decent school

601
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,320
and start the race at the
same starting line.

602
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,750
That might be good.

603
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,420
But if you tax people to
create public schools,

604
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:59,710
if you tax people
against their will,

605
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,870
you coerce them.

606
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,860
It's a form of theft.

607
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:08,300
If you take some of
Letterman's $31 million,

608
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:13,920
tax it away to support public
schools, against his will,

609
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:20,320
the state is really doing
no better than stealing from him.

610
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,990
It's coercion.

611
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:26,820
And the reason is,
we have to think of ourselves

612
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:29,990
as owning our talents
and endowments.

613
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:34,820
Because otherwise we're back to just
using people and coercing people.

614
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,830
That's the libertarian reply.

615
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,800
What's Rawls's answer
to that objection?

616
00:39:48,029 --> 00:39:52,190
He doesn't address the idea
of self-ownership directly.

617
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,760
But the effect, the moral
weight of his argument

618
00:39:56,859 --> 00:39:58,430
for the difference principle is,

619
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:04,370
maybe we don't own ourselves in
that thoroughgoing sense after all.

620
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,880
Now, he says, this doesn't
mean that the state

621
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:14,110
is an owner in me, in the
sense that it can simply

622
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,310
commandeer my life.

623
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,220
Because remember,
the first principle

624
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:21,870
we would agree to behind
the veil of ignorance,

625
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:26,430
is the principle of
equal basic liberties.

626
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,130
Freedom of speech,
religious liberty,

627
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,660
freedom of conscience
and the like.

628
00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:35,810
So the only respect

629
00:40:37,589 --> 00:40:41,560
in which the idea of
self-ownership must give way,

630
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,100
comes when we're thinking
about whether

631
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:51,280
I own myself in the sense that

632
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,550
I have a privileged claim

633
00:40:56,049 --> 00:40:59,660
on the benefits that come from
the exercise of my talents

634
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:01,720
in a market economy.

635
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:04,190
And Rawls says, on
reflection, we don't.

636
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:06,770
We can defend rights.

637
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,070
We can respect the individual.

638
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,480
We can uphold human dignity.

639
00:41:14,549 --> 00:41:19,050
Without embracing the
idea of self-possession.

640
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:27,830
That, in effect, is his reply
to the libertarian.

641
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:31,220
I want to turn now,
to his reply to

642
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,410
the defender of a
meritocratic conception.

643
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:39,580
Who invokes effort as the
basis of moral desert.

644
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:43,340
People who work hard
to develop their talents

645
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:52,610
deserve the benefits that come
from the exercise of their talents.

646
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:57,810
Well, we've already seen the
beginning of Rawls's answer

647
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,220
to that question.

648
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,120
And it goes back to that poll
we took about birth order.

649
00:42:04,779 --> 00:42:06,480
His first answer is

650
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:13,330
even the work ethic, even the
willingness to strive conscientiously,

651
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:17,330
depends on all sorts of
family circumstances and

652
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,160
social and cultural contingencies
for which we can claim no credit.

653
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,740
You can't claim credit for
the fact that you,

654
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:28,930
most of you, most of us, happen
to be first in birth order.

655
00:42:29,569 --> 00:42:33,340
And that for some complex
psychological and social reasons

656
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,860
that seems to be
associated with striving,

657
00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:39,140
with achieving,
with effort.

658
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:41,640
That's one answer.

659
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,390
There's a second answer.

660
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:47,920
Those of you who
invoke effort,

661
00:42:50,759 --> 00:42:56,690
you don't really believe that moral
desert attaches to effort.

662
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:59,200
Take two construction workers.

663
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,840
One is strong and can raise
four walls in an hour

664
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,400
without even breaking
a sweat.

665
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:09,340
And another construction
worker is small and scrawny.

666
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,630
And has to spend three days

667
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,020
to do the same
amount of work.

668
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:21,300
No defender of meritocracy
is going to look at the effort

669
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,860
of that weak an scrawny
construction worker and say

670
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,000
"Therefore he deserves
to make more".

671
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,480
So it isn't really effort.

672
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,510
This is the second reply

673
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:33,890
to the meritocratic claim.

674
00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:36,810
It isn't really effort

675
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:41,840
that the defender of meritocracy
believes is the moral basis

676
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:45,410
of distributive shares.

677
00:43:45,799 --> 00:43:46,850
It's contribution.

678
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,650
How much do you
contribute?

679
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,960
But contribution
takes us right back to

680
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,710
our natural talents and abilities.
Not just effort.

681
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:01,590
And it's not our doing, how
we came into the possession

682
00:44:01,759 --> 00:44:04,690
of those talents in
the first place.

683
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,500
Alright, suppose you
accepted these arguments,

684
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,400
that effort isn't everything,
that contribution matters,

685
00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:17,410
from the standpoint of the
meritocratic conception.

686
00:44:18,299 --> 00:44:22,090
That effort, even,
isn't our own doing.

687
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:28,980
Does that mean,
the objection continues,

688
00:44:29,629 --> 00:44:31,800
does that mean that
according to Rawls,

689
00:44:32,009 --> 00:44:36,640
moral desert has nothing to
do with distributive justice?

690
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,100
Well, yes.

691
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:45,000
Distributive justice is not
about moral desert.

692
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:50,330
Now, here, Rawls
introduces an important

693
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:52,000
and a tricky distinction.

694
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,850
It's between moral desert,
on the one hand,

695
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,940
and entitlements to legitimate
expectations, on the other.

696
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:06,180
What is the difference between
moral deserts and entitlements?

697
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,590
Consider two different games.

698
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:11,100
A game of chance and
a game of skill.

699
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,440
Take a game of pure chance.

700
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,300
Say, I play the Massachusetts
state lottery.

701
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,220
And my number comes up.

702
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,410
I'm entitled to my winnings.

703
00:45:27,779 --> 00:45:30,210
But even though I'm
entitled to my winnings,

704
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:35,150
there's no sense in which,
because it's just a game of luck,

705
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,810
no sense in which, I morally
deserve to win in the first place.

706
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,670
That's an entitlement.

707
00:45:43,509 --> 00:45:45,920
Now contrast the lottery with
a different kind of game.

708
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,360
A game of skill.

709
00:45:50,799 --> 00:45:58,800
Now, imagine the Boston Red Sox
winning the World Series.

710
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:03,990
When they win, they're
entitled to the trophy.

711
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,510
But it can be always
asked of a game of skill

712
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:12,350
did they deserve to win?

713
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:15,930
It's always possible,
in principle,

714
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,290
to distinguish what
someone's entitled to,

715
00:46:20,629 --> 00:46:21,630
under the rules,

716
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,220
and whether they deserve
to win in the first place.

717
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:30,270
That's an antecedent standard.
Moral desert.

718
00:46:32,509 --> 00:46:36,960
Now, Rawls says distributive
justice is not a matter of

719
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:40,430
moral desert though
it is a matter of

720
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:43,780
entitlements to
legitimate expectations.

721
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,850
Here's where he explains it.

722
00:46:48,629 --> 00:46:53,620
"A just scheme answers to
what men are entitles to.

723
00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:59,450
It satisfies their legitimate
expectations as founded upon

724
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,330
social institutions.

725
00:47:02,549 --> 00:47:05,920
But what they are entitled
to is not proportional to

726
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:09,010
nor dependent upon
their intrinsic worth."

727
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,460
"The principles of justice that
regulate the basic structure

728
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:20,120
do not mention moral desert
and there is no tendency

729
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,380
for distributive shares
to correspond to it."

730
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,090
Why does Rawls make
this distinction?

731
00:47:26,609 --> 00:47:28,210
What, morally, is at stake?

732
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,490
One thing morally at stake is
the whole question of effort

733
00:47:32,779 --> 00:47:34,120
that we've already discussed.

734
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:39,050
But there's a second contingency,
a second source of

735
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:42,530
moral arbitrariness
that goes beyond

736
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:45,260
the question of whether
it's to my credit

737
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:47,780
that I have the talents that
enable me to get ahead.

738
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:52,140
And that has to do
with the contingency

739
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:56,450
that I live in an society
that happens to prize

740
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:58,120
my talents.

741
00:47:59,529 --> 00:48:03,110
The fact that David Letterman

742
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,000
lives in a society that
puts a great premium,

743
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:12,330
puts a great value, on a
certain type of smirky joke,

744
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:15,990
that's not his doing.

745
00:48:16,089 --> 00:48:18,860
He's lucky that he happens
to live in such a society.

746
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:24,600
But this is a second contingency.

747
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,170
This isn't something that
we can claim credit for.

748
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:31,410
Even if I had sole,
unproblematic, claim

749
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,500
to my talents and
to my effort.

750
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:37,950
It would still be the case,
that the benefits I get

751
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:40,000
from exercising those talents,

752
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:45,380
depend on factors that are arbitrary
from a moral point of view.

753
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:49,500
What my talents will reap
in a market economy.

754
00:48:49,759 --> 00:48:51,100
What does that depend on?

755
00:48:51,879 --> 00:48:54,760
What other people happen to
want or like in this society.

756
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,000
It depends on the law
of supply and demand.

757
00:48:57,879 --> 00:48:59,450
That's not my doing.

758
00:49:00,629 --> 00:49:03,220
It's certainly not the basis
for moral desert.

759
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:07,450
What counts as contributing

760
00:49:09,299 --> 00:49:13,090
depends on the qualities that this
or that society happens to prize.

761
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:17,980
Most of us are fortunate
to possess, in large measure,

762
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:19,650
for whatever reason,

763
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:23,960
the qualities that our
society happens to prize.

764
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,530
The qualities that
enable us to provide

765
00:49:28,759 --> 00:49:30,200
what society wants.

766
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:35,630
In a capitalist society it helps
to have entrepreneurial drive.

767
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:39,350
In bureaucratic society it helps
to get on easily and smoothly

768
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,920
with superiors.

769
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,580
In a mass democratic society

770
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,680
it helps to look good
on television

771
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:50,530
and to speak in short,
superficial sound bites.

772
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:54,990
In a litigious society,

773
00:49:55,690 --> 00:50:01,130
it helps to go to law school and have
the talents to do well on LSATs.

774
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:04,240
But none of this is our doing.

775
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,910
Suppose that we,
with our talents,

776
00:50:06,089 --> 00:50:09,490
inhabited not our society,
technologically advanced,

777
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:12,730
highly litigious,
but a hunting society,

778
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,220
or a warrior society.

779
00:50:14,629 --> 00:50:16,310
What would become
of our talents then?

780
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:19,240
They wouldn't get us very far.

781
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,060
No doubt some of us
would develop others.

782
00:50:23,799 --> 00:50:25,690
But would we be less worthy?

783
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,560
Would we be less virtuous?

784
00:50:29,549 --> 00:50:33,390
Would we be less meritorious if
we lived in that kind of society

785
00:50:33,649 --> 00:50:35,070
rather than in ours.

786
00:50:36,339 --> 00:50:38,100
Rawls's answer is, no.

787
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,040
We might make less money
and properly so.

788
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:46,690
But while we would
be entitled to less,

789
00:50:47,649 --> 00:50:49,270
we would be no less worthy.

790
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,730
No less deserving
than we are now.

791
00:50:52,879 --> 00:50:54,060
And here's the point.

792
00:50:54,339 --> 00:50:57,220
The same could be said
of those in our society

793
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:00,510
who happen to hold less
prestigious positions,

794
00:51:00,839 --> 00:51:05,100
who happen to have fewer of
the talents that our society

795
00:51:05,259 --> 00:51:07,020
happens to reward.

796
00:51:08,549 --> 00:51:12,320
So here's the moral import
of the distinction between

797
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:16,180
moral desert and entitlements
to legitimate expectations.

798
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,530
We are entitled to
the benefits

799
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:21,190
that the rules of
the game promise

800
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:23,240
for the exercise of our talents.

801
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:27,310
But it's a mistake and
a conceit to suppose

802
00:51:27,569 --> 00:51:29,040
that we deserve,
in the first place,

803
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:34,890
a society that values the qualities
we happen to have in abundance.

804
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:39,060
Now we've been talking here
about income and wealth,

805
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:43,370
what about opportunities
and honors?

806
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:52,910
What about the distribution of access
of seats in elite colleges and universities?

807
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,330
It's true,

808
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:00,190
all of you

809
00:52:01,259 --> 00:52:05,630
most of you first born,
worked hard, strived,

810
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:09,710
developed your talents,
to get here.

811
00:52:12,859 --> 00:52:15,190
But Rawls asks,
in effect,

812
00:52:16,129 --> 00:52:18,670
what is the moral
status of your claim

813
00:52:19,649 --> 00:52:21,350
to the benefits that attach

814
00:52:22,759 --> 00:52:24,930
to the opportunities
that you have?

815
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:31,310
Are seats in colleges
and universities

816
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,850
a matter, a kind of
reward, an honor

817
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,890
for those who deserve them,

818
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,490
because they've
worked so hard?

819
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:44,940
Or, are those seats, those
opportunities and honors

820
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,310
entitlements to
legitimate expectations

821
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:55,310
that depend for
their justification

822
00:52:57,089 --> 00:52:59,990
on those of us
who enjoy them

823
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:06,970
doing so in a way that
works to the benefit

824
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:11,690
of those at the bottom
of society?

825
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:15,500
That's the question that Rawls's
difference principle poses.

826
00:53:16,549 --> 00:53:18,310
It's a question that
can be asked

827
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:22,120
of the earnings of Michael Jordan
and David Letterman

828
00:53:23,129 --> 00:53:24,700
and Judge Judy.

829
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,390
But it's also a question
that can be asked

830
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:32,170
of opportunities to go to

831
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:35,750
the top colleges and universities.

832
00:53:36,009 --> 00:53:38,970
And that's a debate
that comes out

833
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,620
when we turn to the question
of affirmative action next time.
